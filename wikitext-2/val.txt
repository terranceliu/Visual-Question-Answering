 Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles .

 Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
 The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter . 
 The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
 The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : 
 The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . 
 The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
 The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . 
 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 
 Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> . Females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year . 
 The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> . This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . 
 The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . 
 Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there . 
 
 = = Ecology = = 
 
 Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
 The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms . 
 The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
 Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .

 Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned in " The <unk> " a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . 
 <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 <unk> systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .

 Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . 
 H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . 
 The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near <unk> , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . 
 The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is " European lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east . The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of <unk> . The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town . The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land . As the trunkline approaches <unk> , the terrain becomes more wooded near the <unk> River . M @-@ 82 follows <unk> Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 . The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street .

 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of <unk> had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ <unk> vehicles daily .

 = = History = = 
 
 Previously inhabited by the <unk> Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing <unk> Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian <unk> . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . 
 After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( <unk> ha ) , Richard <unk> , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of <unk> 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. <unk> , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from <unk> County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . <unk> and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . 
 There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " Meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " <unk> " ( meaning " mad river " in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed " <unk> City . " Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " Meridian " and " <unk> " each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " Meridian " on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . 
 Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , " Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . " Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
 The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its " Golden Age " from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . 
 The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project . 
 After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
 During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . 
 Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of " <unk> the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . " In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . 
 Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . 
 Meridian Main Street organized several projects to <unk> downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . " 
 After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown .

 Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . 
 As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . 
 The <unk> Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . 
 As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . <unk> of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

 Known for more than a century of arts , Meridian contains many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events . One of the first art organizations in the city , The Meridian Art League , was established in February 1933 . Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian , but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949 , exhibitions were held at various locations around the city . After the Carnegie library at 25th <unk> and 7th St was closed , the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits . The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults . Over thirty exhibitions are held annually , ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials , photography , crafts , and many other works of art . The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits , 20th century photography , and several sculptures . 
 The Meridian Council for the Arts ( <unk> ) was founded as Meridian 's and Lauderdale County 's official arts agency in 1978 . <unk> operates its Community Art Grants program , the annual <unk> Festival , several workshops , and other special events each year . <unk> is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art , the Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian Little Theatre , one of the South 's oldest subscription @-@ based community theatres , was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County , entertaining over 22 @,@ 000 guests each season , making it Mississippi 's most @-@ attended community theatre . The Meridian Symphony Orchestra ( <unk> ) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963 . In 1965 the <unk> booked its first international soloist , <unk> <unk> , to perform with the orchestra . The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus . The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox <unk> , who has been with the orchestra since 1991 . The <unk> will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from <unk> <unk> . 
 The city 's former Grand Opera House was built in 1889 by two half brothers , Israel Marks and Levi <unk> . During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works , the first being a German company 's rendition of Johann <unk> II 's " The <unk> Baron " . After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression , the opera house was abandoned for nearly 70 years . A $ 10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation , a local foundation chartered in 1998 , sparked the building 's restoration while $ 15 million came from a combination of city , county , and federal grants . The opera house 's renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts . " The Riley Center , which includes a 950 @-@ seat auditorium for live performances , a 200 @-@ seat studio theater , and 30 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 2 @,@ 787 m2 ) of meeting space , attracts more than 60 @,@ 000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences , meetings , and performances . 
 Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure <unk> being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century . Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their <unk> due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born <unk> Louis S. <unk> , famous for <unk> the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco <unk> in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building . Noted California <unk> Wallace <unk> designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which <unk> the city across the nearby Alabama State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of <unk> Springs Drive where his <unk> <unk> Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon <unk> , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph <unk> . One <unk> work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s <unk> and which are now in private residences on <unk> Springs Drive and in North Hills . 
 Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in 2001 and in 2006 promised $ 4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $ 8 million . The city donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the cause in September 2007 . The <unk> , as proposed , would be located on 175 acres ( 71 ha ) at <unk> Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre , an indoor concert hall , and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists . The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana 's building . That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $ 300 @,@ 000 . In February 2009 , the <unk> revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame . The first star on the walk was dedicated to <unk> <unk> , a Meridian native . In September of the same year , the second star was revealed , recognizing <unk> King , a famous blues musician from Mississippi . On June 1 , 2010 , authors Tennessee Williams , <unk> <unk> , and William Faulkner were added to the walk . <unk> Ward was added to the walk on June 24 , 2010 . The <unk> plans to add many more Mississippi @-@ born stars to the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman , Jimmy <unk> , Elvis Presley , Conway <unk> , and others . 
 Another location in the city used for large productions is the <unk> Shrine Temple Theater . The Temple Theater houses a <unk> @-@ pipe Robert Morgan organ , one of two Theater <unk> still in their original installations in the state . With seating for 1800 persons , the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple . At the time , it was one of the largest stages in the United States , second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City . Today , seating <unk> persons , the Temple is used year @-@ round for area events , live stage shows , plays , concerts , <unk> Shrine functions , and public screenings of classic movies . 
 Highland Park houses a <unk> <unk> museum which displays the original guitar of " The Singing <unk> " and other <unk> of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . In addition to the museum building itself , there are outside memorials , and a vintage steam <unk> on display . A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of <unk> <unk> and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi . The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta . Also , a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of <unk> on June 1 , 2010 . Each year since 1953 , the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death . 
 The park is also home to a 19th @-@ century <unk> manufactured around 1895 by Gustav <unk> of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Highland Park <unk> <unk> has been in operation since 1909 , is a National Historic Landmark , and is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary <unk> menagerie in existence . Its house is the only remaining original <unk> building built from a <unk> <unk> . Around Town <unk> <unk> is a public arts project of 62 <unk> horses , representing the historic <unk> .

 During the Great Depression , residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance , but in 1935 Brothers Fred and Al Key , managers of the airport , thought of a way to keep the airport operating . From June 4 until July 1 , 1935 , the brothers flew over the city in their plane , the " Ole Miss . " The record they established in their 27 days <unk> , totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes , attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running .

 Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools . From this bond , the <unk> School was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks . 
 From this early district and later additions , the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools . The city also contains several private schools including Lamar School , <unk> Christian School , Community Christian School , and St. Patrick 's Catholic School . The campus of Meridian High School , the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 ha ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms .

 Meridian is served by the Meridian @-@ Lauderdale County Public Library , located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue . The city originally had two Carnegie libraries , both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites . A group of women had formed the <unk> Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current location . The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970 , and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28 , 2008 .

 The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill <unk> ( which runs south from West <unk> ) . To the west the island is <unk> by a belt of glacial <unk> about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow <unk> soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf <unk> ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . 
 The highest point on the island is in the north west at <unk> Field , which rises to 87 metres ( 285 feet ) . <unk> is possibly from the Old Norse for ' <unk> of stones ' .

 On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) island of <unk> <unk> ( which he has renamed " <unk> Island " ) made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown <unk> of <unk> . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to <unk> , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom .

 The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and <unk> rock formations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish <unk> formed part of the Old Red <unk> Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The <unk> of Old Red <unk> , laid down from <unk> to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier <unk> rocks , <unk> by the formation of <unk> , eroded and then were deposited into river <unk> . The freshwater Lake <unk> existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa <unk> is largely made up of ashes and <unk> from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and <unk> ( <unk> ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at <unk> Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene <unk> . 
 <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , cliffs , <unk> and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain . The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet another is ' <unk> 's Hole ' close to <unk> <unk> in the west . This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : 
 ... in <unk> , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so <unk> is the water ... [ with ] <unk> or <unk> like <unk> in a church . 
 In 1953 the spectacular headland , ' Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm . The nearby <unk> of <unk> <unk> also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit .

 Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped <unk> ' . Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " Big island of the <unk> " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west .

 Papa <unk> is the subject of a <unk> manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland . It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke <unk> <unk> , who was later to become King <unk> V of Norway . There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> <unk> , which are the remains of a ' <unk> ' , or local assembly . This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord <unk> <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the <unk> document and was later called ‘ <unk> de <unk> ’ . ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . ) The remains of Duke <unk> 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> <unk> .

 In <unk> Shetland came under nominal Scottish control , although the Norse ' <unk> of Norway ' kept their Papa <unk> estates until the 17th century . In the 16th century merchants from <unk> and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish <unk> , Thomas <unk> of <unk> , and Arthur <unk> of <unk> , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ <unk> boats known as <unk> . 
 In addition to the <unk> colony on <unk> <unk> there may have been another at <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> <unk> . A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony . 
 The island church , which <unk> Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore <unk> , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> <unk> ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " . There is a tradition that the work there was <unk> with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the <unk> were moved overnight by these <unk> agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of <unk> and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . 
 In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West <unk> was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam <unk> saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa <unk> . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . 
 There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or <unk> Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower <unk> , and a rotating upper <unk> driven by the water falling onto the <unk> below . Some were still in use on Papa <unk> in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south <unk> of Shetland .

 In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa <unk> 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. <unk> ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A <unk> and five sheep were offered free of charge to <unk> which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .

 The coasts around Papa <unk> have claimed numerous wrecks . In <unk> , <unk> <unk> alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and Norwegian ships . 
 The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 3 miles northwest of Papa <unk> , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of <unk> to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the <unk> and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the <unk> . A request had been made for the <unk> lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were buried in <unk> . 
 The cargo ship SS <unk> ran aground in fog on <unk> <unk> in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were <unk> and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler <unk> ran aground in <unk> Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the <unk> being awarded the <unk> silver medal for this rescue . 
 Papa <unk> 's most recent <unk> occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , <unk> Alec <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions .

They managed to <unk> all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the <unk> , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the <unk> in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at <unk> Airport .

 The Papa <unk> sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England . A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott . 
 The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa <unk> and <unk> for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , <unk> and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa <unk> . 
 It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the <unk> tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The <unk> chorus chant , ' <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ' , is particularly striking . 
 " <unk> <unk> da Horn o Papa ,

 " <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of <unk> were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa <unk> . The ' tide @-@ <unk> ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The <unk> final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .

 " Angel of Death " is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician <unk> <unk> , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . " Angel of Death " led to the band facing accusations of Nazi <unk> and racism throughout their career . 
 Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , " Angel of Death " is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a " classic " .

 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote " Angel of Death " after reading books about Nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band : " I remember stopping <unk> where I bought two books on <unk> . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . " 
 The lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in " Angel of Death " are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , <unk> , <unk> with lethal <unk> , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . 
 " <unk> together , joining heads . Just a matter of time ' <unk> you rip <unk> apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation <unk> <unk> together twins , one of them deformed ; " the <unk> was <unk> to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . " This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor <unk> Alexander at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ <unk> Adolf <unk> the " architect of the Holocaust " , where it was asserted that <unk> " <unk> the veins together " and turned " them into <unk> twins . " This allegation became more widely known when <unk> Alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for <unk> , which has been cited by several authors including Gerald <unk> , an expert on <unk> . 
 Towards the end of the song , there is a line " Feeding off the screams of the <unk> he 's creating " , which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. <unk> was the villain .

 The lyrical content of " Angel of Death " contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " . Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 . However , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule . 
 " Angel of Death " caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . The controversy led to accusations of Nazi <unk> which have followed Slayer throughout their career . People took Hanneman 's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of <unk> – his most prized item being a German Knight 's Cross . Hanneman <unk> asserting : 
 " I know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it . When they read the lyrics , there 's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? I shouldn 't have to tell you that . " 
 According to guitarist Kerry King : " Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . And of course we got the most <unk> for it in Germany . I was always like , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer 's preaching fucking World War II ? ' People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you 'll never talk them out of it . " 
 The song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not <unk> racism and are merely interested in the subject . 
 In 2006 , the song " <unk> " from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to " Angel of Death " . " <unk> " deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist 's perspective . <unk> Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " Angel of Death " , although it did not <unk> , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is " just Slayer being Slayer " .

 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead <unk> . It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead <unk> faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan <unk> . It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States . 
 The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial release . It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger , <unk> <unk> , Hans <unk> , and Billy Bragg . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is regarded as one of Lead <unk> 's best original works , but it also drew controversy . There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars <unk> that Lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . <unk> have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals .

 Most music historians date the writing of " The <unk> Blues " to Lead <unk> 's June 1937 trip to Washington , DC , when he was invited by the <unk> Alan <unk> to record for the Library of Congress 's folk music collection . On the first night Lead <unk> and his wife Martha spent in the city , they encountered racially <unk> Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( <unk> ) . <unk> , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed " white friend " , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building . The next morning , Lead <unk> <unk> to <unk> arguing with his <unk> about the presence of a black man , with the <unk> threatening to call the police . 
 While in Washington , Lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song . For instance , when Lead <unk> , <unk> , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . Lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> , he would be served . 
 In response to one of these incidents , a friend of Lead <unk> 's , variously identified as either <unk> or Mary Elizabeth <unk> joked that Washington was a " <unk> town . " Though Lead <unk> did not know what the word " <unk> " meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead <unk> to write it . <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .

 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington , DC . It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population . Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to " spread the news all around " about the racial issues <unk> the city . The song , particularly in the refrain , <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as " <unk> " . 
 The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead <unk> encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead <unk> was " turned down " wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over Lead <unk> staying in his apartment . The third verse <unk> cites " the home of the brave , the land of the Free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington , DC . The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district . 
 The song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . 
 " The <unk> Blues " follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format . It is written in 44 time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> . The song was written in B ♭ . It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a <unk> .

 " The <unk> Blues " is one of Lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " . There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . Robert <unk> claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States . There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . After its release , it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups . Lead <unk> was invited to perform at Camp Unity , the Communist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s . This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . The party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . 
 Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . This theory stems from the idea that Lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> . Since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . Lead <unk> admitted that the term " <unk> " was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

 " <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance <unk> , along with " <unk> Up " and " Future Lovers " . It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right . " The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind . Madonna commented that , " Whenever I make records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ] So I thought , screw that . I 'm going to start from that perspective " . She promoted the album at the dance party " <unk> " held at Luke & <unk> 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior <unk> to take over the DJ booth where she mixed " <unk> Up " with " <unk> " .

It then changes to <unk> – <unk> @-@ <unk> in the chorus , while continuing in A ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – <unk> in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines of " I 've heard it all before " . 
 Lyrically the song has <unk> of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it . The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .

 = High Five Interchange = 
 
 The High Five Interchange is one of the first five @-@ level stack interchanges built in Dallas , Texas . Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 , I @-@ 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US Highway 75 , US 75 ) , it replaces an <unk> partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s . 
 The $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 . It was designed by the <unk> Corporation and built by <unk> Construction Corporation . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> to be one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as " Public Works <unk> of the Year " .

 The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
 <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the " High Five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " High Five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
 The roads on the five levels are : 
 Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way 
 Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> as one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " , calling it a " labyrinth of lanes " and a " five @-@ level <unk> of engineering " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . 
 Reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
 <unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for " lane rentals " by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal <unk> of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place . 
 During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge deck . 
 The project was designed by the <unk> Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .

 In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five " Public Works Project of the Year " for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and <unk> of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community . <unk> as the managing agency , <unk> Construction Corporation as the primary contractor , and <unk> Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project .

 Tim Richmond ( June 7 , 1955 – August 13 , 1989 ) was an American race car driver from <unk> , Ohio . He competed in <unk> racing before transferring to <unk> 's Winston Cup Series ( now <unk> Cup Series ) . Richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to <unk> stock cars full @-@ time , which has since become an industry trend . He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight <unk> seasons . 
 Richmond achieved his top <unk> season in 1986 when he finished third in points . He won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . When he missed the season @-@ opening <unk> 500 in February 1987 , media reported that he had pneumonia . The infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system , which was weakened by AIDS . Despite the state of his health , Richmond competed in eight races in 1987 , winning two events and one pole position before his final race in August of that year . He attempted a comeback in 1988 before <unk> I banned him for testing positive for excessive <unk> ( over the counter ) drugs , <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> later announced they gave Tim Richmond a new test and tested negative . Tim Richmond filed a lawsuit against <unk> after <unk> insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him , after losing the lawsuit , Richmond withdrew from racing . <unk> later stated their original test was a " Bad Test . " 
 Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a <unk> lifestyle , earning him the nickname " Hollywood " . In describing Richmond 's influence in racing , Charlotte Motor <unk> president <unk> Wheeler said : " We 've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing . He was almost a James Dean @-@ like character . " When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie <unk> Ace , " He fell right in with the group working on the film , " said director Hal <unk> . Cole <unk> , the main character in the movie Days of Thunder , played by Tom Cruise , was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick <unk> .

 Richmond grew up in <unk> , Ohio . His parents , Al and Evelyn ( née Warner ) Richmond , met in the course of their work . Al was a <unk> for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager . <unk> that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market this invention , he founded Richmond Manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide . 
 Tim 's driving days started as a <unk> when he was given a go @-@ <unk> that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . He later raced the <unk> at tracks in <unk> and New <unk> . Richmond grew up in a well @-@ to @-@ do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami , Florida . During his years in Miami , Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio . While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag <unk> Raymond <unk> through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16 , his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am , a <unk> and a Piper <unk> airplane for his birthday . Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about <unk> her only son . She once said , " Tim was lazy ... " , and " ... I did everything for him . I ruined him , I admit it . He was my whole life . " 
 Richmond excelled in sports ; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his <unk> days were over . Miami Military Academy named him <unk> of the Year in 1970 . Richmond 's other interests included flying , and he earned his private pilot license at age 16 . Following high school graduation , Richmond attended <unk> University for about one year before dropping out .

 A friend of Richmond 's father co @-@ owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker . In 1976 , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Richmond took the car onto <unk> <unk> at <unk> , Ohio for some practice laps . " Somebody put a <unk> on me , " Richmond said . " I was running laps faster than Dave had been . It was the first time I had ever driven a race car . " Richmond and his father found a red , white and blue @-@ colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child . In his first competition at the track , officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat . He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle . Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . After being towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . Later that season , they towed the car to <unk> <unk> , only to have Richmond crash the car again . In response , Richmond 's father fired him as the driver . The next season , Al Richmond bought a <unk> better suited to his son 's driving style . In 1977 Tim Richmond became both <unk> <unk> 's Rookie of the Year and the <unk> class track champion . 
 Richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the United States Automobile Club 's ( <unk> ) national sprint car tour in 1978 . <unk> in 12 races , he finished 30th in points as the series ' Rookie of the Year . That year he attended Jim Russell 's road racing school at <unk> Springs International <unk> Park , setting a student course record . Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini <unk> car event at Phoenix International <unk> , winning the Formula Super <unk> support event in a <unk> <unk> . The win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like Roger <unk> . He also competed in <unk> 's Silver Crown series . 
 Richmond 's father bought an Eagle <unk> Car chassis and an <unk> engine for the 1979 race at Michigan International <unk> . Richmond qualified 21st fastest with a 175 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ <unk> km / h ) lap , significantly slower than Bobby <unk> 's 203 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ 111 km / h ) pole position speed . The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap , and he finished last ( 23rd ) . <unk> Pat <unk> was looking for a driver to replace Larry Rice for his <unk> team at the following race at Watkins Glen International , so he gave Richmond a test at <unk> Spring where he had previously set the student record . <unk> hired Richmond , who then qualified 15th fastest for the event and finished in eighth place , the best of his <unk> career . Richmond raced in three more events that season . 
 After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500 , Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race . He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race . To the delight of the crowd , winner Johnny Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits . He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year . " I <unk> up a few <unk> cars right after that , " he said . " Milwaukee , Mid @-@ Ohio . . . at Michigan I cut one in two . I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt . So when I got an offer to drive stock cars , I took it , and it turned out I liked driving them better . "

 <unk> <unk> President Joseph <unk> III convinced Richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the <unk> circuit . Richmond made his first <unk> start two months after winning the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award . He debuted at the Coca @-@ Cola 500 at <unk> on July 27 , 1980 , finishing 12th in a D. K. <unk> @-@ owned <unk> . That season , he competed in five events , with two <unk> ( did not finish ) and three 12th @-@ place finishes . Overall , he finished the 1980 season 41st in points . 
 Richmond raced for three teams in 1981 . He started the season by competing in 15 events for <unk> . He had his first career top 10 finish , taking sixth place at <unk> <unk> , soon followed by a seventh @-@ place finish at Texas World <unk> . After <unk> <unk> hired him away from <unk> mid @-@ season , Richmond had top 10 finishes at <unk> and Bristol . For the final seven races of the season , he drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International <unk> . Overall for the season , Richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points . 
 Richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one @-@ race deal to drive for Billie Harvey at the <unk> track . Richmond completed 112 laps of the <unk> @-@ lap event to finish 31st , retiring from the race with engine problems . For the following event , Richmond was hired to drive <unk> Stacy 's No. 2 car . In his first race for the team , Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington <unk> . Returning to <unk> , he finished second , before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside , California the following week . Later that season , he earned his first pole position at Bristol . The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race , sweeping both events at the track . Benny Parsons said that " watching Richmond go through the <unk> was unbelievable " . For the season , Richmond had twelve top 10s , two wins , and one pole to finish 26th in points . 
 In 1983 , Richmond began racing for Raymond <unk> whom he had known before he started racing . He returned to the three @-@ cornered <unk> racetrack , earning his first oval victory . During the season , he accumulated four pole positions ( Darlington , <unk> , Charlotte , and Atlanta ) , one win ( <unk> ) , and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points . He made his first appearance in a <unk> Busch Series ( now Nationwide Series ) car , but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season . 
 <unk> magazine named Richmond as one of " the best of the new generation " in 1984 . That year he had one win at North <unk> <unk> and second @-@ place finishes at Dover , Darlington and Riverside . Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points , with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 . In 1985 , the final season that Richmond competed for <unk> , his best finish was a second @-@ place run at Bristol . He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races . In the Busch Series , he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered , and won the Charlotte race . 
 Richmond joined <unk> <unk> in 1986 , where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde . It took the team until the middle of the season to gel . Richmond had suffered a 64 @-@ race <unk> streak that was finally broken at the Van <unk> Diamond Mine 500 at <unk> in June 1986 . After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside , Richmond started the <unk> event in third place inside the second row . That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point . <unk> wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official , so the <unk> body had the drivers slowly circle the track . It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their <unk> . Two hours later , the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third . After Richmond 's car was adjusted to remove the " push " , the car was more to his liking . Because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate with his crew chief , Hyde , and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left . Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end . After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race , Dale <unk> made up three seconds on Richmond 's five @-@ second lead . With four laps to go , <unk> <unk> spun in a three @-@ car accident . The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the <unk> flag for the victory . He had led 97 laps , including the final 30 , taking his first victory in a Rick <unk> car . 
 The tour returned to <unk> a month later , and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event . In the final 8 @-@ lap sprint , Richmond competed in a three @-@ car battle with Geoff <unk> and Ricky <unk> . Richmond crossed the finish line beside <unk> , winning the race by 0 @.@ 05 seconds . He notched four more victories that season , and over a span of twelve races , Richmond earned three second @-@ place finishes , and six wins . The National <unk> Press Association named him Co @-@ Driver of the Year with <unk> after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10 . He had a career @-@ best third @-@ place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986 , in what was his last full <unk> season .

 Richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 <unk> annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York . He was not well enough to begin the 1987 <unk> season despite lengthy hospitalization in Cleveland and further rest at home ; when Richmond missed the <unk> 500 , his condition was reported as double pneumonia . Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune <unk> syndrome ( AIDS ) . He returned to <unk> for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year . Starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over Bill Elliott . In the middle of the race , Richmond 's car suffered <unk> problems . Because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . Richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , " I had tears in my eyes when I took the <unk> flag . Then every time anyone <unk> me , I started <unk> again . " Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside , and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International <unk> 's Champion <unk> <unk> 400 that August , finishing 29th with a blown engine . He resigned from <unk> <unk> in September 1987 . 
 Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 , <unk> suspended him for testing positive for banned substances . The substances were identified as <unk> , a non @-@ <unk> over @-@ the @-@ counter allergy medication , and <unk> , an over @-@ the @-@ counter pain reliever . In April 1988 , Richmond sued <unk> over the suspension . Although he <unk> later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . In his final public appearance in February 1988 , Richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test . His suit with <unk> was settled out @-@ of @-@ court , the terms sealed . 
 Richmond withdrew into his <unk> in Florida . There were by then rumors of HIV and AIDS , which he denied . He was later hospitalized in West Palm Beach . 
 ESPN sent a get @-@ well @-@ soon card to Richmond when it aired the July 1989 <unk> race at <unk> . The television network showed highlights of Richmond 's victory at the track from 1986 . " Tim had Hollywood good looks and the <unk> of Tom Cruise , " said his friend Dr. Jerry Punch . " There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him . It was important for the people at the hospital to see Tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital . " 
 On August 13 , 1989 , Richmond died at the age of 34 , about two years after his final <unk> race . He was buried in <unk> , Ohio . 
 The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . At the time , Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . Ten days after his death , on August 23 , the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS , which he acquired from an unknown woman . Richmond 's physician , Dr. David Dodson , said : " There 's no way of knowing who that woman was . Tim was a celebrity with a lot of <unk> , a handsome guy . He naturally attracted a lot of women . " Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond 's death .

A series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 <unk> 500 kept Richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race ... " , the report said . The New York Times published the findings . While neither Tennant nor <unk> supplied an official response at the time , <unk> did confirm that they were seeking to replace Tennant . 
 The <unk> County Sports Hall of Fame inducted Richmond in their second class in 1996 . In 1998 , <unk> named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time . He was inducted into the International <unk> Hall of Fame in 2002 . The Mansfield <unk> Park <unk> Re / Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond Memorial <unk> Re / Max 250 in honor of the area native . The race at Mansfield was co @-@ promoted by <unk> 's son Joseph <unk> III .

 The <unk> Creek Mountains are a remote , semi @-@ arid Great Basin mountain range mostly in southeastern Oregon and partially in northern Nevada in the United States . The range 's highest point is <unk> View <unk> , 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level , in Nevada . Disaster Peak , elevation 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains . 
 The mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . <unk> generally north to south , the <unk> Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other <unk> , on top of older <unk> rocks . The southern end of the range , however , features many <unk> <unk> . As a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <unk> and canyons . 
 Most of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management . There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines at the <unk> <unk> produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century . Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . <unk> includes large <unk> of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . Sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits . 
 Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat for the rare <unk> <unk> trout . Fish populations in the <unk> Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . In the 1980s , the effects of grazing <unk> on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . The <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . The <unk> met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .

 The <unk> Creek Mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada , in Harney and Humboldt counties . The nearest human settlements are the <unk> Ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mountains ; Fields , Oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; <unk> , Nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and <unk> , Nevada – Oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . The mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of Boise , Idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of <unk> , Nevada . 
 The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area of <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Nevada ( 22 % ) . The highest point in the range is <unk> View <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border . About two miles southeast of <unk> View is Disaster Peak , " a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region . " At 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The <unk> . 
 The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney – <unk> county line ( according to the United States Geological Survey 's definitions ) , while the <unk> Mountains are the next range west of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The <unk> Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by <unk> Cabin Creek and South Fork <unk> Creek . South of the <unk> Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley , which separates the <unk> Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east . 
 The terrain in the <unk> Creek Mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <unk> cut by deep canyons . The canyons have steep walls with loose <unk> slopes at the <unk> . There are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @-@ round . Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> Creek . These streams all flow into <unk> basins in Harney County , Oregon . <unk> Creek and <unk> Creek are the largest of the four . The Kings River and <unk> Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The Kings River begins in The <unk> and flows south into Nevada , where it meets the Quinn River , which <unk> in the Black Rock Desert . <unk> Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The <unk> and flows generally east , crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of <unk> .

 The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . The <unk> Creek Mountains are <unk> and <unk> blocks with steep <unk> along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range , known as The <unk> , has numerous <unk> of Cretaceous age granite . These granite <unk> are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic <unk> . 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where <unk> Mountain is today . <unk> thinning and the Yellowstone <unk> , which was then beneath southeastern Oregon , induced eruptions from <unk> and nearby <unk> about 17 million years ago , in the Miocene . The <unk> produced a series of <unk> flows that spread across the land now known as the <unk> Creek Mountains . <unk> from the <unk> volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate <unk> flows occurred . Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <unk> rocks that may be related to some of the <unk> age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon . Within these <unk> rocks are <unk> and <unk> <unk> bodies which were presumably <unk> during the Cretaceous Period . 
 The broad <unk> <unk> is a prominent geologic feature in the <unk> Creek Mountains . The oval @-@ shaped <unk> is a collapsed <unk> dome that <unk> the Oregon – Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide . The <unk> dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene . A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large <unk> dome structure . The <unk> formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . The <unk> contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the <unk> . Other areas in the <unk> were mined for ores of antimony , <unk> , and lithium . 
 
 = = Climate = = 
 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the <unk> Creek Mountains . As a result , the average annual precipitation in the <unk> Creek Mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June . Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . <unk> at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by April ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June . Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the <unk> <unk> . 
 The prevailing winds are from the west @-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest in March and April . <unk> , intense thunderstorms are common between April and October . <unk> in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .

 <unk> in the <unk> Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . Other common shrubs include <unk> , snowberry , and <unk> . There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . Common grass species include Idaho <unk> , bluebunch wheatgrass , <unk> , western <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , as well as basin <unk> in some well @-@ drained areas . 
 Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian <unk> ( vegetation along stream banks ) . However , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . The meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping <unk> or in stream <unk> , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ) . <unk> riparian <unk> follow the year @-@ round streams . Many <unk> areas have <unk> <unk> and <unk> groves . <unk> and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is <unk> and stream channels are wider . <unk> and rushes are also native to these stream <unk> . Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young <unk> and <unk> trees . Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s . However , large <unk> in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .

 Animals in the <unk> Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert . <unk> are common in the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and <unk> groves . There are also <unk> sheep , cougars , and <unk> in the high country . Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they <unk> the Great Basin . Some other mammals include the northern pocket <unk> , mountain <unk> , and <unk> 's ground <unk> . North American <unk> live in and along streams , as do Pacific tree frogs , western <unk> toads , and <unk> snakes . Native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain <unk> , gray @-@ headed <unk> , black @-@ throated gray <unk> , Virginia 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , pine <unk> , red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thrush , northern <unk> , and species of <unk> and eagle . 
 Several streams in the <unk> Creek Mountains are home to trout , including the rare <unk> <unk> trout subspecies . These include <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Little <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Fifteen Mile Creek , Indian Creek , Sage Canyon Creek , Line Canyon Creek , and some tributaries of <unk> Creek . <unk> <unk> trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the <unk> Creek Mountains . These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . For most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably . It was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 . Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , <unk> , competition with other fish , and <unk> with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure <unk> <unk> trout . However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .

 The Bureau of Land Management ( <unk> ) administers most land in the <unk> Creek Mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . The private lands are mainly used for <unk> along mountain streams , while the <unk> lands include large grazing <unk> for local ranchers ' cattle . At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration . Commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the <unk> <unk> , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted . <unk> in what was called the <unk> <unk> District produced 270 @,@ 000 <unk> of mercury — " the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from <unk> extracted from the <unk> in the 20th century . The two leading mercury @-@ producing mines in North America were the <unk> and <unk> mines on the edge of the <unk> in Nevada . Together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 . The <unk> Mine , the last mercury mine in the United States , closed three years later , in 1992 . However , mineral exploration has continued at the <unk> Mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of <unk> as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <unk> project . 
 The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience . <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . The only developed recreation site nearby is at <unk> Creek Hot Springs , just south of the <unk> Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits . <unk> on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> . There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 <unk> grazing in the <unk> Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century , and the <unk> currently <unk> grazing <unk> in the area . <unk> can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s . 
 
 = = Land @-@ management compromise = = 
 
 By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains . 
 Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . Next , the agency sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . 
 As environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . Initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs . 
 Initial members of the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group included : 
 Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings were all open to the public . 
 The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being of ranchers . In 1989 , the <unk> Ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures . The <unk> 's <unk> on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its <unk> Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed . In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 . Finally , sensitive areas were <unk> to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . Other <unk> also agreed to rest specific pastures including the <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing <unk> management plan . It was based on the agreements made by the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group , and it took effect in 1992 . Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the <unk> Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have found that the <unk> <unk> trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

The cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap ) . The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly <unk> odor and taste . The gills have a <unk> attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length of the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with <unk> of red . They are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to <unk> spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem .

 Mycena <unk> is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It <unk> this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : <unk> , <unk> and lignin . 
 The fruit bodies of Mycena <unk> grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , <unk> mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York . It has been found in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast .

 Capel <unk> ( sometimes referred to as Hen <unk> <unk> ) is a ruined chapel near <unk> <unk> in Anglesey , north Wales , dating back to the first half of the 12th century . The chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . It was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair . The walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof . 
 It contains a 16th @-@ century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is " a substantially 12th @-@ century structure " with the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " .

 The oldest parts of Capel <unk> date from the first half of the 12th century . This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @-@ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the <unk> to gain control of the island . The reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown . Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby . <unk> and <unk> , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of <unk> <unk> and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right . The chapel is sometimes referred to as " Hen <unk> <unk> " ( " hen " being the Welsh word for " old " and " <unk> " meaning " chapel " ) . 
 The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century . A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the Pierce <unk> . In 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmospheres " for the album " You Have Just Been <unk> By The <unk> " by The <unk> , a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the <unk> , Super <unk> Animals and <unk> that was described by one journalist as " possibly the <unk> pop group of all time " . 
 For a time , Capel <unk> was used as a private place of worship for <unk> House , a " venerable mansion " once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William <unk> , 1st Baron Boston , in the 18th century . After the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . The walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone . 
 Capel <unk> is in the Anglesey countryside near <unk> ; the parish church of St <unk> , <unk> is about 0 @.@ 78 miles ( 1 @.@ 26 km ) away . Part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches . It is cared for by Cadw , the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales , and is open to the public .

There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat ) and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located ) . There are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide ) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall . There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel . The vault , which is about 27 square feet ( 2 @.@ 5 m2 ) , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel . <unk> slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above .

 Capel <unk> has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12th @-@ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " , even though it is now in a " ruinous condition " . Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " . 
 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian <unk> <unk> mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey . She said that the architecture was of " the <unk> kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great antiquity . " She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeletons , which <unk> into dust , when exposed to the air " . She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth " . 
 A 1990 book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey , and calls Capel <unk> a " medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously <unk> with the spirit of a pagan past " . It notes that " the wheel has turned full circle and Capel <unk> today is just another ruined relic of a former age . " The authors describe the chapel as a " simple , square building " with a " small and <unk> austere south chapel " , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

 <unk> <unk> b ( abbreviated <unk> <unk> b , <unk> And b ) , occasionally designated <unk> <unk> <unk> ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf <unk> <unk> B ) , also named <unk> , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light @-@ years away from the Sun in the constellation of <unk> . The planet orbits the Solar twin star , <unk> <unk> A , approximately every five days . Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey <unk> and R. Paul Butler , it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered . It is also one of the first non @-@ resolved planets to be detected directly . <unk> <unk> b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was <unk> for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega <unk> Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al @-@ <unk> of Muslim Spain . 
 
 = = Discovery = = 
 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , <unk> <unk> b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the <unk> shift of <unk> <unk> 's spectrum . The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 <unk> b and the planet orbiting <unk> <unk> . 
 Like 51 <unk> b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , <unk> <unk> b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ <unk> days to complete an orbit , with a <unk> axis of 0 @.@ <unk> AU . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect <unk> <unk> b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of <unk> <unk> b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . <unk> is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees . 
 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that <unk> <unk> b is a gas giant with no solid surface . 
 The <unk> Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of <unk> <unk> b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees <unk> , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees <unk> . The temperature difference has led to speculation that <unk> <unk> b is <unk> locked with the same side always facing <unk> <unk> A. 
 <unk> had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted <unk> <unk> b to have reflective clouds of <unk> and iron in its upper atmosphere . The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a <unk> of cooler gas . The outer shell of dark , <unk> , hot cloud is assumed to consist of <unk> and <unk> oxides ( " <unk> planets " ) , but other compounds like <unk> cannot be ruled out yet . 
 The planet is unlikely to have large moons , since <unk> forces would either <unk> them from orbit or destroy them on short <unk> compared to the age of the system . 
 The planet ( with 51 <unk> b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by <unk> . Preliminary results from <unk> studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times as large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is <unk> / cm3 . It has a <unk> albedo of 0 @.@ 35 in visible light . 
 
 = = <unk> on its sun = = 
 
 <unk> <unk> b appears to be responsible for increased <unk> activity on its parent star . Observations suggest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @-@ planetary point . This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of <unk> <unk> <unk> variable stars , or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io .

 Daniel Jacob <unk> ( born 23 July 1989 ) is an English actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the Harry Potter film series . He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One 's 1999 television film David Copperfield , followed by his cinematic debut in 2001 's The <unk> of Panama . At age 11 , he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film , and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011 .

He starred in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black , and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your <unk> . 
 He has contributed to many charities , including <unk> Hospice Care for Children , and The Trevor Project for suicide prevention among <unk> youth , which gave him its Hero Award in 2011 .

 <unk> was born in West London , England . He is the only child of Alan George <unk> , a literary agent , and Marcia <unk> <unk> ( née Marcia <unk> Jacobson ) , a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC , including The Inspector <unk> Mysteries and Walk Away and I <unk> . His father , who was raised in <unk> , County Down , Northern Ireland , is from " a very working @-@ class " Protestant background . His mother is Jewish , and was born in South Africa and raised in <unk> @-@ on @-@ Sea , Essex . Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia . <unk> 's parents had both acted as children . 
 In a 2012 interview , <unk> stated : " There was never [ religious ] faith in the house . I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish , despite the fact that I 'm English . " He has stated : " We were Christmas tree Jews " , and that he is " very proud of being Jewish " . 
 <unk> first expressed a desire to act at the age of five , and in December 1999 , aged 10 , he made his acting debut in BBC One 's televised two @-@ part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield , portraying the title character as a young boy . He was educated at two independent schools for boys : Sussex House School , a day school in Chelsea 's <unk> Square , and the City of London School , a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London 's financial district ( known as the City of London ) . <unk> school became difficult for <unk> after the release of the first Harry Potter film , with some fellow pupils becoming hostile , though he says it was people just trying to " have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter " rather than jealousy . 
 As his acting career began to consume his schedule , <unk> continued his education through on @-@ set tutors . He admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work " really difficult . " He achieved A grades in the three <unk> @-@ level exams that he took in 2006 , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university . Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience . " The <unk> , they 'd love it , " he told Details magazine in 2007 . " If there were any parties going on , they 'd be tipped off as to where they were . "

 In 2000 , producer David <unk> asked <unk> to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone , the best @-@ selling book by British author J. K. <unk> . <unk> had been searching for an unknown British actor to <unk> the character , and the movie 's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking , " This is what I want . This is Harry Potter " , after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield . Eight months later , and after several auditions , <unk> was selected to play the part . <unk> also endorsed the selection saying , " I don 't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry . " <unk> 's parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles . Warner Bros. instead offered <unk> a two @-@ movie contract with shooting in the UK ; <unk> was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that . 
 The release of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone in the United States ) took place in 2001 . <unk> received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was " not that important " to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him . The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews , and critics took notice of <unk> : " <unk> is the embodiment of every reader 's imagination . It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing , " wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle . 
 A year later <unk> starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of <unk> , the second installment of the series . Reviewers were positive about the lead actors ' performances but had <unk> opinions on the movie as a whole . The 2004 release Harry Potter and the <unk> of <unk> was the third film in the series . <unk> 's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O.

His performance earned several award nominations , and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for " Best Male Performance . " As his fame and the series continued , <unk> , <unk> , and Watson left <unk> of their hands , feet , and <unk> in front of <unk> 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . In July 2009 Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince was released , the series ' sixth instalment . <unk> received nominations for " Best Male Performance " and " Global <unk> " at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards . 
 For financial and <unk> reasons the last book was divided into two films , shot back to back , which drew criticism from the series ' fanbase . <unk> defended the split , stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film . He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast @-@ paced with a lot of action , while the first part would be far more <unk> , focusing on character development ; he added that , had they combined them , those things would not have made it to the final cut . Filming lasted for a year , concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting , like most of the cast and crew , <unk> openly <unk> . 
 The final film , Harry Potter and the <unk> <unk> – Part 2 , was released in July 2011 . <unk> , along with the film , was critically acclaimed : Ann <unk> of The Washington Post asked , " Who could have predicted that <unk> , <unk> and Watson would turn out to be good actors ? " ; similarly , Rex Reed said : " <unk> , I ’ m sorry to see [ <unk> ] go " ; while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on <unk> : " Well played , sir . " Roger <unk> gave the film a highly positive review , but felt that <unk> , <unk> and Watson were " upstaged by the supporting [ actors ] . " 
 <unk> admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character , but also said he is " proud to be associated with this film series forever . " Despite positive feelings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films . After <unk> hinted about writing an eighth book , <unk> was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : " [ It is ] very doubtful . I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character . " Despite <unk> so much time to the series , <unk> has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : " I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter .

 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace <unk> , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and <unk> updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace <unk> was also <unk> towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The <unk> Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to <unk> . 
 Perry has described the production " ... Thirteen Years Later " as being " one of the most <unk> " of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode . Guest star Jeff <unk> , who played killer Mark Bianco , is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher , who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black 's wife Catherine .

This represented approximately 5 @.@ 37 million households . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " received mixed reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B " . VanDerWerff felt that the episode 's comedic <unk> was necessary within the wider series , as he considered Millennium 's dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this . VanDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when <unk> the character of Frank Black , but admitted that it " falls apart " when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " ... Thirteen Years Later " one star out of five . Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better , but that " the whole concept drowns in <unk> " . He considered the episode 's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy @-@ handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss .

Between the southern terminus and I @-@ 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four @-@ lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through <unk> . This section includes a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and <unk> Cemetery . North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two @-@ lane highway . North of the South <unk> Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and <unk> County . The obsolete Delaware & <unk> Canal usually stands between the river and the highway . Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely <unk> due to the tree canopy . Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in <unk> . 
 Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown <unk> to Newark , following present @-@ day Route 179 and US 202 between <unk> and <unk> and US 22 between <unk> and Newark . The route between <unk> and Frenchtown was originally Route <unk> . In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route <unk> to avoid the <unk> with the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren Street in <unk> and I @-@ 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I @-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 . A realignment of Route 29 in <unk> by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 @.@ 26 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 42 km ) Route 165 .

 = = History = = 
 
 The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from <unk> to the New York border in <unk> Township . Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from <unk> to Newark . The original route ran from downtown <unk> along State Street and <unk> Drive . From there , it followed its current alignment to <unk> , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to <unk> to present @-@ day County Route <unk> , which it followed to Woods Tavern . The route turned north on U.S. Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to <unk> , where it followed U.S. Route 22 to Newark . The current alignment of Route 29 from <unk> to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route <unk> in 1927 . 
 The alignment of Route 29 between <unk> and <unk> was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between <unk> and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and <unk> . In 1938 , Route <unk> was planned as an extension of Route <unk> from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route <unk> . In 1948 , a spur route , Route <unk> , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in <unk> to the New Hope @-@ <unk> Bridge . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was <unk> to continue north from <unk> to Frenchtown on Route <unk> , and the Route 29 designation between <unk> and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between <unk> and <unk> and U.S. Route 22 between <unk> and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route <unk> and Route <unk> became Route 165 . 
 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between <unk> and <unk> ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in <unk> to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of <unk> ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of <unk> and in Ewing Township became Route 175 . 
 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , <unk> Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in <unk> . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 . 
 By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in <unk> to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .

 = First <unk> invasion of Burma = 
 
 The first <unk> invasions of Burma ( <unk> ) ( <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) ) were a series of military conflicts between <unk> Khan 's Yuan dynasty , division of the <unk> Empire , and the Pagan Empire that took place between <unk> and <unk> . The invasions toppled the 250 @-@ year @-@ old Pagan Empire , and the <unk> army seized Pagan territories in present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and northern Burma to <unk> . The invasions <unk> in 250 years of political fragmentation in Burma and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China . When King <unk> refused , Emperor <unk> Khan himself sent another mission in <unk> , again demanding tribute . It too was rejected . In 1275 , the emperor ordered the <unk> government to secure the <unk> in order to block an escape path for the Song , and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested . Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the <unk> Army in <unk> – 78 . After a brief lull , <unk> Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . When the <unk> king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma . Two dry season campaigns ( <unk> – 85 ) later , the Mongols had occupied down to <unk> and <unk> , forcing the <unk> king to flee to Lower Burma . The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of <unk> . 
 <unk> negotiations began in <unk> , and ended with <unk> finally agreeing to submit in June <unk> . The <unk> embassy , received by the emperor in Beijing in January <unk> , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the <unk> of the Yuan dynasty or the <unk> Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the <unk> government in exchange for the evacuation of <unk> troops from northern Burma . But the treaty never really took effect as <unk> was assassinated in July <unk> , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . The <unk> command at <unk> now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central Burma . They may not have reached Pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to <unk> . 
 The Pagan Empire <unk> and anarchy ensued . The Mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . In March <unk> , they accepted the voluntary submission of King <unk> of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( <unk> ) . But <unk> was overthrown nine months later , and the Mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in 1300 – 01 . 
 Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( <unk> – 87 ) in his <unk> , Il <unk> . The <unk> referred to the invaders as the <unk> ( after the central Asian <unk> troops that largely made up the <unk> invasion army ) ; today , the term <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) refers to the Han Chinese instead . King <unk> is <unk> remembered in <unk> history as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the King who <unk> from the <unk> " ) .

 In the 13th century , the Pagan Empire , along with the Khmer Empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . For much of its history , Pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent <unk> Kingdom and its predecessor <unk> , both with <unk> as their capital city . <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times <unk> themselves with the <unk> Empire to their west and at other times with China 's Tang and Song dynasties . Indeed , <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself . 
 Between the newly conquered <unk> territory and Pagan were a wide <unk> of <unk> stretching from present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and <unk> prefectures in <unk> as well as the <unk> and <unk> regions ( presumably in present @-@ day northern Shan State ) , which Pagan and <unk> had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . Then as now , the <unk> mostly consist of <unk> <unk> of high mountain ranges .

 The <unk> Empire first arrived at the <unk> of the Pagan Empire in <unk> by invading the <unk> Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China . The <unk> armies captured the capital , <unk> , on 7 January <unk> , and went on to <unk> much of the kingdom by <unk> . 
 The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the <unk> as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by <unk> @-@ speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former <unk> Kingdom . 
 
 = = = Decline of Pagan = = = 
 
 By then , the Pagan Empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century . The continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – 60 in South <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion . The crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy .

 The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early <unk> . By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor <unk> Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the Mongols . 
 When the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister <unk> <unk> was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King <unk> to use diplomacy . The king was furious at the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting for weeks . The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing . The king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious <unk> regions in April <unk> . The rebel leader A @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought back to Pagan . <unk> relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action .

 At Beijing , <unk> Khan , who was preparing an invasion of Japan , decided against a war with Pagan — for the time being . On 3 March <unk> , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the First Secretary to the Board <unk> , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . The letter says : 
 " If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All @-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with Us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? <unk> well , O king , Our words . " 
 This time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( The <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . But both <unk> <unk> evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time . The newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . 
 
 = = = <unk> consolidation of <unk> ( 1275 – 76 ) = = = 
 
 Meanwhile , in <unk> , the former <unk> Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ Din Omar as governor . In May 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the <unk> evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward . 
 But the emperor rejected an outright invasion . Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees . He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover . As planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in 1275 – 76 . ( Elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most of the Song territory by <unk> . ) 
 By <unk> , at least one <unk> vassal state named " Gold <unk> " ( modern <unk> ) had submitted to the Mongols . Like in <unk> , the <unk> government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in <unk> , the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . Though it was ultimately under <unk> command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were <unk> @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further west : Turks from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but also captive soldiers from the Persian <unk> empire , the <unk> , and even <unk> from the lower <unk> .

 What followed was a border war in <unk> – 78 . It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the <unk> of Marco Polo . Although the <unk> chronicles have no record of the border war , a <unk> <unk> inscription mentions the army 's defeat at <unk> . The <unk> accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate .

 According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo 's accounts , a <unk> army " invaded " the <unk> territory of Gold <unk> , and was defeated by the <unk> army in April <unk> . The battle took place either at the <unk> valley ( in present @-@ day <unk> Prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> Prefecture ) , which the <unk> called <unk> . 
 The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a <unk> army of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 <unk> . It also reports only one <unk> was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the <unk> army consisted of 12 @,@ 000 mounted <unk> , and the <unk> army numbered 60 @,@ 000 men with 2000 <unk> , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @-@ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @-@ armed fighting men . " Even then , the 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 figures of the <unk> army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have <unk> " on the side of generosity " not to " <unk> their glory in defeating superior numbers . " 
 According to Marco Polo 's account , in the early stages of the battle , the Turkish and <unk> horsemen " took such <unk> at the sight of the <unk> that they would not be got to face the <unk> , but always <unk> and turned back , " while the <unk> forces pressed on . But the <unk> commander <unk> did not panic ; he ordered his troops to <unk> , and from the cover of the nearby <unk> , aim their bows directly at the advancing <unk> . The <unk> <unk> ' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .

 The <unk> army pressed on after the monsoon season . In the following dry season of <unk> – 78 , c .

They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned <unk> . But they found the heat excessive and returned .

 Despite the <unk> military success , the control of the <unk> remained contested . Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the <unk> , apparently taking advantage of <unk> <unk> elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at <unk> and <unk> later in <unk> , posting permanent garrisons commanded by <unk> <unk> . But their control was short @-@ lived . The Great Khan 's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281 . He had had mixed success : his <unk> forces had finished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281 . That year , the <unk> emperor sent another mission to Pagan , demanding tribute yet again . The <unk> king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court . ( With <unk> , the emperor summoned the king of <unk> himself to Beijing . ) 
 At Pagan , <unk> <unk> with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . The <unk> court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma . ( He also ordered an invasion of <unk> , whose king too had refused to submit . ) The <unk> king 's troubles did not go <unk> elsewhere in the kingdom . In the same year , a <unk> named <unk> seized the southern port city of <unk> ( <unk> ) by killing its Pagan @-@ appointed governor . Although the king 's three sons were <unk> of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on <unk> . 
 Throughout <unk> , the <unk> command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of <unk> and northern Burma . The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not <unk> an attack on Pagan itself . At least one army consisted of 14 @,@ 000 men of the <unk> Persian <unk> Empire under the command of <unk> <unk> was sent to <unk> to reinforce the Burma invasion force , which again was made up of Turks and other central <unk> . On the <unk> side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . By mid @-@ <unk> , a <unk> army led by generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> was deployed at a fort at <unk> .

They took the ancient <unk> capital of <unk> , about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February <unk> . There , the invaders paused their advance . They found the heat of the searing <unk> valley excessive , and evacuated <unk> , allowing the <unk> to return to <unk> on 10 May <unk> . But the <unk> army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . They retook <unk> , and defeated another <unk> stand south of <unk> , probably near <unk> , on 26 January <unk> , opening the way to Pagan , about 270 km south . After the defeat , the king <unk> , and fled to Lower Burma . The evacuation proved premature . The <unk> forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . 
 The country fell into chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at <unk> , west of <unk> . Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . The governor of <unk> <unk> that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was in open revolt .

 Given his precarious position , <unk> decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the Mongols . In November / December <unk> , the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . The <unk> commanders at <unk> , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . They repeated their 1281 demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor . The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March <unk> , which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ Chung ) . After a long <unk> , the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw . In June <unk> , he sent an embassy led by Shin <unk> <unk> , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .

 In January <unk> , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly . He did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom . He preferred a vassal ruler . The <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in May <unk> , and reported the terms to the king .

 But the agreement broke down a month later . In late June , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan . But on 1 July <unk> , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son <unk> , the Viceroy of <unk> . Anarchy ensued . Each region in the country which had not <unk> broke away . No successor to <unk> , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing , emerged . Indeed , a king would not emerge until May <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> intervention ( <unk> ) = = 
 
 Given the chaos , the governor of <unk> ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . The <unk> army commanded by Prince <unk> @-@ sin <unk> , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward Pagan . According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era ) scholarship , the <unk> army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out <unk> to receive homage , one of which reached south of <unk> . But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary <unk> / Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary <unk> of the conquest . 
 Recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . ( An inscription dated 16 February <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army . ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> . They remained there as the treaty was now void . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete . But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They would send no more expeditions to restore order . The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country . Indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented . " It would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons , <unk> , emerged as king of Pagan in May <unk> . But the new " king " controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers . 
 The uneasy arrangement would persist until <unk> . The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to <unk> as the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of <unk> on 18 August <unk> . Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers <unk> consolidating support . To check their rising power , <unk> submitted to the Mongols in January <unk> , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor <unk> Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March <unk> . The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of <unk> . The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . On 17 December <unk> , the three brothers <unk> <unk> , and founded the <unk> Kingdom . The <unk> forced the <unk> government to intervene again , leading to the second <unk> invasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years later , on 4 April <unk> , the Mongols abolished the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , evacuated <unk> , and returned to <unk> .

 The war was one of several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century . Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma . The invasions <unk> in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 
 = = = Age of political fragmentation = = = 
 
 The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire . However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . Pagan 's disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and <unk> . " The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century . Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” . But the dynasty could not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . As a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century . It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . The vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai @-@ Shan states well into the 16th century . 
 
 = = = Rise of Tai @-@ Shan states = = = 
 
 Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the <unk> invasions was the emergence of Tai @-@ Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia . The Tai @-@ Shan people who came down with the <unk> invasions stayed . By the early 14th century , several Tai @-@ Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @-@ day <unk> to northern and eastern <unk> to northern and central Thailand and Laos . Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols , who viewed the states as a useful <unk> between <unk> and the rest of Southeast Asia . The Mongols , who were still trying to incorporate <unk> into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of <unk> into the fold . ( The integration of <unk> itself into “ China <unk> ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . ) As such , from the newly formed Tai @-@ Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and <unk> in eastern Southeast Asia , the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . ”

 The war also marked the arrival of China at the <unk> of Burma . The old <unk> Kingdom , known to the <unk> as <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , after <unk> Raj ) was now a <unk> Chinese province .

Today , King <unk> is remembered as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the King who fled from the <unk> [ Chinese ] ) . ) From a <unk> standpoint , the <unk> – Chinese presence in <unk> pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma ( and parts of the Khmer Empire ) .

 The Battle of <unk> 's Ridge , also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge , Battle of Raiders Ridge , and Battle of the Ridge , was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II between Imperial Japanese Army and Allied ( mainly United States Marine Corps ) ground forces . It took place from 12 – 14 September 1942 , on <unk> in the Solomon Islands , and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives during the <unk> Campaign . 
 In the battle , U.S. Marines , under the overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander <unk> , repulsed an attack by the Japanese 35th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Japanese Major General <unk> <unk> . The Marines were defending the <unk> perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on <unk> , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on <unk> on 7 August 1942 . <unk> 's unit was sent to <unk> in response to the Allied landings with the mission of <unk> the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island . 
 <unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> – about 12 @,@ 000 – <unk> 's 6 @,@ 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses . The main Japanese assault occurred around <unk> ridge south of Henderson Field , manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units , primarily troops from the 1st <unk> and 1st Parachute Battalions under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. <unk> . Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun , <unk> 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese . 
 Because of the key participation by <unk> 's unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as " <unk> 's " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources . After <unk> 's Ridge , the Japanese continued to send troops to <unk> for further attempts to retake Henderson Field , affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific .

 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on <unk> , <unk> , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia . They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long <unk> campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the Allied landing forces had secured <unk> and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the north shore of the island of <unk> east of the present day capital of <unk> . <unk> placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on <unk> in a loose perimeter around the <unk> Point area . 
 On 12 August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major <unk> Henderson , a Marine <unk> who had been killed at the Battle of Midway . The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the " <unk> Air Force " after the Allied code name for <unk> . 
 In response to the Allied landings on <unk> , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> — with the task of retaking <unk> from Allied forces . The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern <unk> area . Of these units , the 35th Infantry Brigade — under Major General <unk> <unk> — was at <unk> , the 4th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment — under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> — was embarked on transport ships near Guam . The different units began to move toward <unk> immediately ; <unk> 's regiment — the closest — arrived first . The " First <unk> " of <unk> 's unit — consisting of about <unk> soldiers — landed from destroyers at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the <unk> perimeter , on August 19 . 
 <unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> , <unk> 's First <unk> conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at <unk> Creek on the east side of the <unk> perimeter in the early morning hours of August 21 . <unk> 's assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the Battle of the <unk> : all but 128 of the <unk> men of the First <unk> ( including <unk> himself ) were killed in the battle . The survivors returned to <unk> Point , notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul . 
 By 23 August , <unk> 's unit had reached <unk> and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to <unk> . Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern <unk> , the Japanese decided not to deliver <unk> 's troops to <unk> by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying <unk> 's soldiers were sent to Rabaul . From there , the Japanese planned to deliver <unk> 's men to <unk> by destroyers , staging through a Japanese naval base in the <unk> Islands . The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " The <unk> " to <unk> and back in a single night , <unk> their exposure to Allied air attack . However , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to <unk> with them . These high @-@ speed destroyer runs to <unk> , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese . The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies . However , any Japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks . This " curious tactical situation " held for several months . 
 
 = = = <unk> movement = = = 
 
 On 28 August , 600 of <unk> 's troops were loaded onto the destroyers <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , designated Destroyer Division 20 ( <unk> ) . Because of a shortage of fuel , <unk> could not make the entire round trip to <unk> at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which <unk> fuel . At 18 : 05 that day , 11 U.S. dive bombers from <unk> @-@ 232 under the command of Lt. Col. Richard <unk> , flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked <unk> about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north of <unk> , sinking <unk> and heavily damaging <unk> and <unk> . <unk> took <unk> in tow and the three destroyers returned to the <unk> without completing their mission . The attack on <unk> killed 62 of <unk> 's soldiers and 94 crew members . 
 Subsequent " Express " runs were more successful . Between 29 August and 4 September , various Japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @,@ 000 troops at <unk> Point , including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade , one battalion of the <unk> Regiment , and the rest of <unk> 's regiment . General <unk> , who landed at <unk> Point on the 31 August Express run , was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on <unk> . On the night of 4 / 5 September , as three of the Express destroyers — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two U.S. ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " <unk> " by the U.S. Marines ) USS Little and Gregory that were used to <unk> Allied troops around the <unk> / <unk> area . 
 In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , <unk> insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to <unk> by slow barges . Therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @,@ 100 of <unk> 's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges , mainly from the 2nd Battalion , <unk> Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> , departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September . On 4 – 5 September , aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment . Most of the remaining 1 @,@ 000 troops were able to land near <unk> ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ S 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ E ) , west of the <unk> perimeter over the next few days . By 7 September , <unk> had 5 @,@ 200 troops at <unk> Point and 1 @,@ 000 west of the <unk> perimeter . <unk> was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces . <unk> believed that there were only about 2 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines on <unk> . 
 During this time , <unk> continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the <unk> perimeter . Between 21 August and 3 September , he relocated three Marine battalions — including the 1st <unk> Battalion , under U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. <unk> ( <unk> 's Raiders ) , and the 1st Parachute Battalion — from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> . These units added about 1 @,@ 500 troops to <unk> 's original 11 @,@ 000 men defending Henderson Field . The 1st Parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> in August , was placed under <unk> 's command .

 <unk> set the date for his attack on the <unk> perimeter for 12 September and began marching his forces west from <unk> towards <unk> Point on 5 September . He <unk> 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on 9 September , and that naval warships be stationed off <unk> Point on September 12 to " destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island . " On 7 September , <unk> issued his attack plan to " <unk> and <unk> the enemy in the vicinity of the <unk> Island airfield . " <unk> 's plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the <unk> perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . <unk> 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while <unk> 's Second <unk> — renamed the <unk> Battalion — would attack from the east . The main attack would be by <unk> 's " Center Body " , numbering 3 @,@ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the <unk> perimeter . By 7 September , most of <unk> 's troops had started marching from <unk> towards <unk> Point along the coastline . About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands <unk> Defence Force , Martin <unk> — told the Marines of Japanese troops at <unk> , near the village of <unk> , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of <unk> . <unk> launched a raid against the Japanese troops at <unk> . Destroyer transports USS McKean and <unk> and two patrol boats took <unk> of <unk> 's men to <unk> in two trips . <unk> and his first wave of <unk> troops landed at <unk> at 05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 September . <unk> by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , <unk> 's men advanced towards <unk> village but were slowed by Japanese resistance . At 11 : 00 , the rest of <unk> 's men landed . With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , <unk> 's force pushed into the village . The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards <unk> Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . Two Marines were killed . 
 In <unk> , <unk> 's troops discovered the supply base for <unk> 's forces , including large <unk> of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a <unk> radio . The Marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the <unk> perimeter at 17 : 30 . The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 @,@ 000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack . 
 <unk> and Colonel Gerald Thomas , <unk> 's operations officer , believed that the Japanese attack would come at the <unk> Ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ S 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ E ) parallel to the <unk> River just south of Henderson Field . The ridge offered a natural <unk> of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . <unk> and Thomas tried to persuade <unk> to move forces to defend the ridge , but <unk> refused , believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . Finally , Thomas convinced <unk> that the ridge was a good location for <unk> 's Raiders to " rest " from their actions of the preceding month . On 11 September , the 840 men of <unk> 's unit — including the 1st Raiders and the <unk> — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it . 
 <unk> 's Center Body of troops was planning to attack the <unk> perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) because of its shape . On 9 September , <unk> 's troops left the coast at <unk> Point . <unk> into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their <unk> attack points south and southeast of the airfield . <unk> of good maps , at least one faulty <unk> , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and <unk> , costing a lot of time . At the same time , <unk> 's troops approached the <unk> perimeter from the west . <unk> had some intelligence on the Marine defenses , extracted from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August . 
 During the day of 12 September , <unk> 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks . <unk> wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . <unk> was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west . Only the <unk> battalion reported that they were in place on time . Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , <unk> was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses . Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , including two killed . 
 
 = = = First night 's action = = = 
 
 The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . The ridge around which <unk> deployed his men consisted of three distinct <unk> . At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge . The <unk> <unk> was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . <unk> placed the five companies from the <unk> battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 . Two of the five <unk> companies , " B " and " C " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy <unk> , and the <unk> River . Machine @-@ gun teams from " E " Company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . <unk> placed his command post on Hill 123 . 
 At 21 : 30 on 12 September , the Japanese cruiser <unk> and three destroyers shelled the <unk> perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a <unk> . Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines , but did little damage . At the same time , scattered groups of <unk> 's troops began <unk> with Marines around the ridge . <unk> 's 1st Battalion — led by Major <unk> <unk> — attacked the <unk> 's " C " company between the <unk> and the <unk> River , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge . <unk> 's unit became entangled with troops from <unk> 's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night . <unk> , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " Due to the <unk> jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless . " Twelve U.S. Marines were killed ; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . Although both <unk> in the west and the <unk> unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn . 
 At first light on 13 September , <unk> Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . The Japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from <unk> 's battalion . At 05 : 50 , <unk> decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night . 
 
 = = = Second night 's action on the ridge = = = 
 
 <unk> the Japanese to attack again that night , <unk> directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge . After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to <unk> the night before , <unk> <unk> his forces . He pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @,@ 800 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) , starting at the <unk> River and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of Hill 123 . Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies . Any Japanese attackers <unk> Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123 . With only a few hours to prepare , the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . They were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each Marine . <unk> ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of <unk> 's troops . In addition , a battery of four <unk> howitzers from the 11th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with <unk> 's front line units . 
 Late in the afternoon , <unk> stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying , 
 You men have done a great job , and I have just one more thing to ask of you . <unk> out just one more night . I know we 've been without sleep a long time . But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . 
 <unk> 's speech " raised the spirits " of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . 
 As the sun set on 13 September , <unk> faced <unk> 's 830 Marines with 3 @,@ 000 troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery . The night was pitch black , with no moon . At 21 : 00 , seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . <unk> 's attack began just after nightfall , with <unk> 's battalion assaulting <unk> Company B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 . Under Marine artillery fire , <unk> reassembled his men and continued his attack . Without <unk> to try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby Marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , <unk> 's unit <unk> forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the <unk> River , heading for the airfield . <unk> 's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations . Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to " <unk> themselves " on the " C " and " K " rations . <unk> ordered his men to continue the attack . At about 03 : 00 , he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as Hill 123 . In the heavy fighting that followed , <unk> and around 100 of his men were killed , ending that attack . 
 Meanwhile , <unk> 's 2nd Battalion , under Major <unk> Tamura , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge . Marine observers spotted Tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire . At about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns hit Tamura 's position . In response , two companies of Tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up Hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . Tamura 's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also <unk> Company B , pushing the <unk> off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the <unk> . To protect the exposed <unk> Company B , <unk> immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123 . 
 At the same time , a Japanese company from <unk> 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. <unk> that their positions were now <unk> , Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 . In the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . A few Marines began <unk> that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas , <unk> other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within <unk> . Other Marines began to follow them . Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a <unk> , <unk> , Major Kenneth D. Bailey from <unk> 's staff , and other Marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , <unk> the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123 . 
 As the Marines formed into a <unk> @-@ shaped line around Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge . Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese <unk> , the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura 's men . Tamura 's troops <unk> a 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines . This gun , which " could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . At midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , <unk> ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . With fixed bayonets , the <unk> swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . Marines from other units , as well as members of <unk> 's command staff , including Major Bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 , who were running critically low . Said Marine participant Captain William J. <unk> , " The Japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that <unk> for a moment and then <unk> the harder ... When one wave was <unk> down - and I mean <unk> down - another followed it into death . " 
 The Japanese hit <unk> 's left flank just after the <unk> took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle , machine @-@ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . Marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese . A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the Marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived . 
 By 04 : 00 , after <unk> several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , <unk> 's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment , who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn . Throughout the night , as <unk> 's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses , <unk> remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123 , <unk> his troops and directing their defensive efforts . Said Marine Captain <unk> Smith , who was in position to observe <unk> for most of the night , " I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , <unk> did it that night . He stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most of us <unk> the ground . " 
 During the heavy fighting , portions of three Japanese companies , including two from Tamura 's and one from <unk> 's battalions , <unk> the Marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire , and reached the edge of " Fighter One " , a secondary runway of Henderson Field . A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat . The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after <unk> . Most of the rest of <unk> 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night . 
 As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . But with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing <unk> of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , <unk> 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended . About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 . At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , <unk> the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .

 As the battle on the ridge took place , <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the <unk> perimeter . The <unk> battalion — led by Major Takeshi <unk> — attacked the southeastern sector of the <unk> perimeter , defended by Marines of the 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 3 / 1 ) . <unk> 's attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back . <unk> was killed in the attack . After <unk> , the Marines , believing that the rest of <unk> 's battalion was still in the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines ; four Japanese 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) anti @-@ tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them . After abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks ' <unk> were <unk> and killed by the Japanese . One tank <unk> down an embankment into the <unk> River , drowning its crew . 
 At 23 : 00 on 14 September , the remnants of the <unk> battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines , but were repulsed . A final " weak " attack by the <unk> unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated . 
 <unk> 's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the <unk> perimeter . At about 04 : 00 on 14 September , two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September . The rest of <unk> 's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack .

 At 13 : 05 on 14 September , <unk> led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . <unk> 's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <unk> River valley to join with <unk> 's unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) march over difficult terrain . <unk> 's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September . Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . As the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to <unk> their heavy equipment and then their rifles . By the time most of them reached <unk> 's positions at <unk> five days later , only half still carried their weapons . The <unk> battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow <unk> 's Center Body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost <unk> to death before finally reaching <unk> 's camp . 
 In total , <unk> 's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack , including 350 in Tamura 's battalion , 200 in <unk> 's battalion , 120 in <unk> 's force , 100 in the <unk> battalion , and 60 in <unk> 's battalion . An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the <unk> . On and around the ridge , the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead , including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123 . The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September . 
 On 17 September , <unk> sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese . The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear @-@ guards for the withdrawal , and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated . The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by <unk> . By nightfall , the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving . On 20 September , a patrol from <unk> 's Raiders encountered stragglers from <unk> 's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them . 
 As the Japanese regrouped west of the <unk> , the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their <unk> defenses . On 14 September , <unk> moved another battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment ( 3 / 2 ) , from <unk> to <unk> . On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units ) to <unk> . These reinforcements allowed <unk> — beginning on 19 September — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the <unk> perimeter . <unk> 's forces ' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <unk> River from 23 – 27 September and 6 – 9 October .

 On 15 September , General <unk> at Rabaul learned of <unk> 's defeat , the Imperial Japanese Army 's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war . The general <unk> the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan . In an emergency session , the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " <unk> might develop into the decisive battle of the war . " The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific . <unk> realized that , in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on <unk> , he could no longer support the major Japanese offensive on the <unk> Track in New Guinea . <unk> — with the <unk> of the General Headquarters — ordered his troops on New Guinea , who were within 30 mi ( 48 km ) of their objective of Port Moresby — to withdraw until the <unk> matter was resolved . The Japanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at <unk> 's Ridge contributed not only to Japan 's defeat in the <unk> campaign , but also to Japan 's ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific . 
 After delivering more forces during the next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on <unk> , led by <unk> , in late October 1942 at the Battle for Henderson Field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese . <unk> later stated that <unk> 's assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , " we would have been in a pretty bad condition . " Historian Richard B. Frank adds , " The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942 , on a ridge <unk> up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best known ever after as Bloody Ridge .

 Route 50 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 26 @.@ 02 mi ( 41 @.@ 88 km ) from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) and the Garden State Parkway in Upper Township , Cape May County to an intersection with US 30 and County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) in <unk> Harbor City , Atlantic County . The route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of <unk> , <unk> City , <unk> Manor , and Mays Landing . <unk> 50 intersects several roads , including Route 49 in <unk> , US 40 in Mays Landing , and US 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township . 
 The portion of current Route 50 between <unk> and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in <unk> Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 .

 Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the <unk> section of Upper Township , Cape May County , heading to the north on a two @-@ lane undivided road . From the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden State Parkway . The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings . It intersects CR <unk> in <unk> before coming to a junction with CR <unk> . Later , Route 50 Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of <unk> . At this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a <unk> with CR 610 . Upon leaving Petersburg , Route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line , intersecting CR <unk> . It continues to <unk> and comes to CR <unk> . Past this intersection , the route meets CR <unk> and CR <unk> . Route 50 forms a concurrency with CR <unk> and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route 49 before leaving <unk> . 
 Not far after Route 49 , the road crosses the <unk> River into <unk> City , Atlantic County . In <unk> City , it heads into residential areas , with CR <unk> <unk> to the west of the route . Route 50 and CR <unk> continue northwest and intersect CR 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . At the junction with CR 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters <unk> Manor , becoming Broad Street . CR <unk> splits from Route 50 by heading northwest on Buena <unk> Road and Route 50 heads through some agricultural <unk> concurrent with CR <unk> Truck , passing to the west of the <unk> Wildlife Area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . The route intersects CR <unk> , turning to the northeast . 
 After passing some homes and Stephen Lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of <unk> Manor County Park . The route crosses the South River into <unk> Township , passing the residential community of <unk> to the east and meeting CR <unk> . It soon enters Hamilton Township , where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with US 40 ( Harding Highway ) . CR <unk> Truck heads to the west on US 40 at this point while Route 50 heads east on US 40 , and CR <unk> continues north . 
 US 40 and <unk> 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the Great <unk> Harbor River . Upon passing over the river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing . Here , the road crosses CR <unk> , and US 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road . Meanwhile , Route 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through developed areas . It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests . The route turns to the northeast , passing near the <unk> Leaf Lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) . 
 Past this interchange , Route 50 <unk> to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . The route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into Galloway Township , where there is an intersection with CR <unk> . A short distance later , the road crosses New Jersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the <unk> Harbor City Station and enters <unk> Harbor City , turning into Philadelphia Avenue . A block after the railroad crossing , Route 50 ends at an intersection with US 30 and CR <unk> ( White Horse Pike ) , with CR <unk> continuing north on Philadelphia Avenue at this point . 
 Route 50 is an important route linking the Atlantic City Expressway with the Jersey Shore resorts in Cape May County , serving as an alternate to more <unk> routes . It also serves as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the event of a hurricane .

 = Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> = 
 
 Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) on 3 September 1978 , during the Rhodesian Bush War . The aircraft involved , a Vickers Viscount named the <unk> , was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury , via the resort town of <unk> . 
 Soon after Flight <unk> took off , a group of <unk> guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a Soviet @-@ made <unk> 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared <unk> missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of <unk> was <unk> by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . Of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . 
 <unk> leader Joshua <unk> publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the <unk> in an interview with the BBC 's Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . The majority of <unk> , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming <unk> <unk> and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black <unk> supported attacks of this kind . Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the Rhodesian government 's <unk> . 
 <unk> between <unk> and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with Smith calling <unk> a " monster " . On 10 September , Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) . The attack on <unk> in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . Five months later , in February 1979 , <unk> shot down Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self @-@ governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to <unk> declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and Rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went <unk> internationally . Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
 Two rival communist @-@ backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese @-@ aligned Zimbabwe African National Union ( <unk> ) , mostly comprising <unk> , created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of <unk> doctrine , while the <unk> @-@ dominated Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( <unk> ) , aligned with Soviet @-@ style <unk> – <unk> and the Warsaw Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) . These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the " Second <unk> " against the Rhodesian government and security forces . The resulting conflict , the Rhodesian Bush War , began in earnest in December 1972 , when ZANLA attacked <unk> and <unk> <unk> in north @-@ eastern Rhodesia . 
 After the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> . Around the same time , Rhodesia 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the <unk> leader Joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976 . <unk> and <unk> announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint " Patriotic Front " . 
 In March 1978 , Smith and non @-@ militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <unk> <unk> , the Reverend <unk> <unk> and Chief Jeremiah <unk> agreed what became the " Internal Settlement " . This created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 , pursuant to <unk> elections . <unk> and <unk> were invited to participate , but refused ; <unk> <unk> dubbed Smith 's black colleagues " the blacksmiths " . <unk> proclaimed 1978 to be " The Year of the People " as the war continued . Officials from <unk> 's United African National Council , sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks , were killed by Marxist – <unk> guerrillas . <unk> also began to target Christian missionaries , <unk> in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at <unk> Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June . 
 The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . No country recognised Rhodesia 's interim administration . Smith again worked to bring <unk> into the government , hoping this would lend it some <unk> domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat ZANLA . Starting on 14 August 1978 , he attended secret meetings with <unk> in <unk> , Zambia ( where <unk> was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation <unk> . Attempts were made to also involve the <unk> leader Robert <unk> , but <unk> would have no part in the talks . According to the South African military historian <unk> <unk> , negotiations between Smith and <unk> progressed well and " seemed on the verge of success " by the start of September 1978 . On 2 September , Smith and <unk> revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .

 Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . The weapon that made such attacks feasible for <unk> was the <unk> 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher , supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid @-@ 1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact 's materiel support . By September 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful . Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War . 
 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 
 Air Rhodesia was the country 's national airline , established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed Central African Airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year . Based at Salisbury Airport , Air Rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the South African cities of Johannesburg and Durban . 
 The Flight <unk> aircraft was a Vickers Viscount <unk> , a British @-@ made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . It was named the <unk> after the river of the same name , which flowed between Lake <unk> and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury . 
 The <unk> was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of <unk> . Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on <unk> by <unk> guerrillas on the northern side of the <unk> ( in Zambia ) , the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations . The flight on 3 September 1978 , Sunday afternoon , from <unk> to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most of whom were <unk> from Salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake . The flight took off from <unk> Airport on schedule soon after 17 : 00 Central Africa Time . 
 Flight <unk> was <unk> by 36 @-@ year @-@ old Captain John Hood , a native of <unk> who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966 . He had flown <unk> for Air Rhodesia since 1968 , and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis . His first officer , Garth Beaumont , was 31 years old , and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from South Africa . The two air <unk> were <unk> <unk> , 21 years old and from <unk> , and 23 @-@ year @-@ old Louise Pearson , from Salisbury .

 A group of <unk> guerrillas , armed with a <unk> @-@ 2 launcher , waited in the bush beneath Flight <unk> 's <unk> , and fired on the <unk> about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight . The heat @-@ seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode .

 At 17 : 10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash . " We 're going in , " he <unk> . <unk> his passengers to <unk> for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the <unk> Hills , in the bush to the west of <unk> , intending to belly land the craft . The landing was relatively stable until the <unk> hit a previously unseen ditch , <unk> and exploded . The remaining fuel tanks <unk> and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin <unk> . 
 
 = = = Massacre on the ground = = = 
 
 Of the 56 people on board , 38 , including Hood and Beaumont , died in the crash . Eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . After briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , Dr Cecil <unk> , led four others — young <unk> Robert and Shannon <unk> , Mrs Sharon <unk> , and her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter Tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . The other 13 remained close to the wreckage . Meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 . Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army <unk> Anthony Hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same . This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) . 
 The guerrillas , who were armed with AK @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . They spoke in English , both to the survivors and among themselves . They told the passengers to <unk> around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others . The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . Standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons . " You have taken our land , " one of them said . " Please don 't shoot us ! " one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . 
 Having collected water from the nearby village , <unk> and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . <unk> it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told <unk> 's group to " come here " . The insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting <unk> and the others to flee . Hill and the <unk> also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their <unk> , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 . The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the <unk> <unk> around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again . 
 The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to <unk> Hospital , while <unk> and his group were <unk> to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury .

 <unk> claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC 's Today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of most Rhodesian observers , both black and white . He said that he had received intelligence that the <unk> was being used for military purposes . <unk> said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground ; by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . He also accused Air Rhodesia of <unk> <unk> troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that Captain Pat Travers , Air Rhodesia 's general manager , called a " downright , deliberate lie " . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of <unk> , <unk> was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo @-@ guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race <unk> Scouts unit , which had often been accused of <unk> rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion . <unk> asserts that the massacre " cannot be put beyond " the Scouts , and also supports <unk> 's claim that the <unk> had been used militarily , suggesting that <unk> might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board . " Rhodesian television , before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique , had shown <unk> ferrying paratroopers for the job , " he writes , " ...

" Indeed , the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with <unk> , and many turned their minds to exacting <unk> for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . The prominent Indian @-@ Rhodesian <unk> family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack . Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours . Smith wrote in his memoirs that the " degree of anger ... [ was ] difficult to control " . White South Africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the <unk> had raped the female passengers before <unk> them . A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of <unk> to anybody who would either kill <unk> or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial . 
 Geoffrey <unk> , who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became <unk> and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be " terrorist <unk> " . Describing the Herald <unk> the night of the incident , he relates a " <unk> collective temper " among the white sub @-@ editors : " They cursed until their voices became <unk> , threatening dire consequences for all <unk> and <unk> or <unk> ... I <unk> that some of the more derogatory remarks made in <unk> loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears . " 
 Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . According to the Time article , a group of whites entered an <unk> Salisbury bar " fingering the <unk> of rifles " and forced blacks drinking there to leave . Time also reported a <unk> that two white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . Smith says that several would @-@ be <unk> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay for their crime of <unk> and assisting the terrorists " . He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme <unk> , and that it would not do to attack them . Many <unk> also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target .

 At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight <unk> 's passengers and crew at Salisbury 's Anglican Cathedral , about 2 @,@ 000 people crowded inside , with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets . <unk> among those present in the cathedral were <unk> Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel , as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . Smith and several government ministers also attended , including P K van der <unk> , the co @-@ Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
 Dean John de Costa gave a sermon <unk> what he described as a " <unk> silence " from overseas . " Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but <unk> at the events attending the Viscount , " he said . " But are we <unk> with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves <unk> ? We are not ! Like men in the story of the Good <unk> , they pass by on the other side ... The <unk> of this ill @-@ <unk> flight from <unk> will be burnt upon our memories for years to come .

 The talks between Smith and the <unk> leader that had been progressing so <unk> were immediately halted by Salisbury . Smith himself called <unk> a " monster " . <unk> comments that the ending of the Smith – <unk> talks at this time was " potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre " , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . He <unk> that an agreement between the two " at this critical stage " might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition . 
 On 10 September , the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed . He declared Rhodesia 's intent to " <unk> the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism " , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for " any defensive strikes we might undertake " against guerrilla bases in their respective territories . He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front . William Irvine , the co @-@ Minister of Transport , warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia " w [ <unk> ] not let these <unk> go <unk> " .

 Because <unk> and <unk> were based in Zambia , many <unk> <unk> for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount <unk> was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around <unk> in Mozambique . The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation <unk> , destroying much of the ZANLA presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called " New <unk> " , slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals . In a combined airborne @-@ ground assault called Operation <unk> , the Rhodesian Air Force , Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New <unk> on 20 September 1978 . Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA 's aid in the form of nine Soviet @-@ made T @-@ 54 tanks and four Russian <unk> @-@ 152 armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces . According to Rhodesian figures , there were " several hundred " guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only two soldiers , one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike .

 Rhodesia then attacked <unk> 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter <unk> @-@ Bowyer later described as " <unk> time " for Flight <unk> . Operation <unk> , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . <unk> 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central <unk> , was the formerly white @-@ owned <unk> Farm , which had been transformed into <unk> 's main headquarters and training base under the name " Freedom Camp " . <unk> presumed that Rhodesia would never <unk> to attack a site so close to <unk> . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior <unk> staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were <unk> , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of <unk> , and <unk> Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . <unk> targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . 
 <unk> by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon , who identified himself to <unk> Airport tower as " Green Leader " , a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding <unk> radar ) and took control of the country 's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on <unk> Farm , informing <unk> tower that the attack was against " Rhodesian dissidents , and not against Zambia " , and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were <unk> the <unk> airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off . The <unk> <unk> all of Green Leader 's instructions , made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic . Using <unk> airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base , the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three @-@ day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> personnel , as well as some Cuban instructors . 
 Historians Paul <unk> and Peter <unk> write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of <unk> 's army , then numbering about 10 @,@ 000 fighters , had not been touched . On the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid . <unk> and <unk> comment that for the Rhodesian airmen , it would have been " impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young <unk> recruits . " <unk> describes Freedom Camp as " a refugee camp for boys " , and says " <unk> boys and girls " were killed . He claims that the Red Cross and the UN <unk> Agency " confirmed <unk> 's claim that Smith 's forces struck at <unk> , civilian <unk> " . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and <unk> bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . <unk> and the <unk> President Kenneth <unk> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively . Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three @-@ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 . Air Rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ <unk> shielding for its <unk> . Before this work was completed , <unk> shot down a second Viscount , Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , on 12 February 1979 . This time there were no survivors . 
 Following the second <unk> , Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the <unk> would be coated with low @-@ radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently <unk> . According to tests conducted by the Air Force , a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the <unk> 's targeting system once it was over 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . There were no further Viscount <unk> in Rhodesia . 
 In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms , boycotted by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> won a majority , and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted , majority @-@ ruled state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979 . This new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in December 1979 the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia , the UK government and the Patriotic Front , returning the country to its former colonial status . The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period . Fresh elections were won by <unk> , who took power in April 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as Zimbabwe .

 In modern Zimbabwe , it is not the Viscount <unk> but rather the <unk> Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . State media in Zimbabwe , prominently the Herald newspaper , often claim that Rhodesian forces <unk> and deliberately <unk> thousands of helpless refugees during such operations . <unk> 's <unk> of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board . The massacre of surviving Flight <unk> passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than <unk> ; in his 1984 memoirs <unk> repeated his claim that <unk> fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that " I truly have no idea how the ten died " . 
 A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on <unk> was built in Zambia in 1998 , and dedicated jointly by the <unk> and <unk> governments . A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents , dubbed the Viscount Memorial , was erected on the grounds of the <unk> Monument in <unk> , South Africa in 2012 , and inaugurated on 1 September that year . The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft . A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag . 
 A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate <unk> in February 2013 to <unk> <unk> the Viscount attacks and <unk> the victims on the anniversary of the second <unk> prompted <unk> in the <unk> press , with the Herald branding it a racist " <unk> motion " intended to <unk> the <unk> administration and its supporters . <unk> <unk> , a former <unk> commander , described the move as a <unk> motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House . Christopher <unk> , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling <unk> 's proposed commemoration " a <unk> ... [ that ] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle . There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country . " <unk> 's official response to <unk> 's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts " civilians get caught up in cross @-@ fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount <unk> with those killed at <unk> .

 <unk> ( / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ’ al in modern <unk> <unk> ) is the ruins of an ancient city found in a <unk> in Guatemala . <unk> <unk> , a gum @-@ <unk> , reported the ruins to La <unk> , a <unk> newspaper , which named the site <unk> . After the Berlin Academy of Sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , <unk> and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . Today tourism to the site may help protect the <unk> . It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre @-@ Columbian Maya civilization . It is located in the archaeological region of the <unk> Basin in what is now northern Guatemala . Situated in the department of El <unk> , the site is part of Guatemala 's <unk> National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 <unk> was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , <unk> reached its <unk> during the Classic Period , c . 200 to 900 AD . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout <unk> such as the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that <unk> was conquered by <unk> in the 4th century AD . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at <unk> and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century . 
 <unk> is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces . 
 
 = = Etymology = = 
 
 The name <unk> may be derived from <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " at the <unk> " . The name was apparently applied to one of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region . It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place of the voices " in the <unk> Maya language . <unk> , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s . <unk> inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , meaning " First <unk> " . <unk> may have come to have been called this because <unk> <unk> also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name . The kingdom as a whole was simply called <unk> , which is the reading of the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo . Its precise meaning remains obscure . 
 
 = = Location = = 
 
 The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa <unk> , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest . <unk> is approximately <unk> kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of Guatemala City . It is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary Maya city of <unk> and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of <unk> . The city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great Classic Period rival , <unk> , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest of <unk> 's ally <unk> , now in Belize . 
 The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @,@ 000 structures . The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised <unk> spanning the swamps . The area around <unk> has been declared as the <unk> National Park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) . 
 The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the <unk> of lowland Maya civilization . The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the <unk> Peninsula . <unk> trees at the <unk> park include gigantic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) the sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Honduras mahogany ( <unk> <unk> ) . Regarding the fauna , <unk> , white @-@ <unk> <unk> , gray foxes , <unk> 's spider monkeys , <unk> monkeys , <unk> eagles , falcons , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , green parrots and <unk> ants can be seen there regularly . <unk> , <unk> , and cougars are also said to <unk> in the park . For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . The average annual rainfall at <unk> is 1 @,@ <unk> millimetres ( 76 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities , <unk> had no water other than what was collected from <unk> and stored in ten reservoirs . Archaeologists working in <unk> during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use . 
 The <unk> National Park covers an area of 575 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @.@ 33 sq mi ) . It was created on 26 May 1955 under the auspices of the <unk> de <unk> e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala . 
 
 = = Population = = 
 
 Population estimates for <unk> vary from 10 @,@ 000 to as high as 90 @,@ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . 
 The population of <unk> began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <unk> Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 @,@ 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @,@ 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . However , some archaeologists , such as David Webster , believe these figures to be far too high .

 There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC , in the Middle <unk> . A <unk> of <unk> ceramics dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed <unk> , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber . 
 Major construction at <unk> was already taking place in the Late <unk> period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still <unk> by sites further north such as El <unk> and <unk> . At this time , <unk> participated in the widespread <unk> culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire <unk> Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize . 
 Two temples dating to Late <unk> times had masonry @-@ walled <unk> that may have been <unk> @-@ vaulted , although this has not been proven . One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a <unk> background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red . 
 In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and <unk> underwent a political and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined . At the end of the Late <unk> , the <unk> style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence <unk> , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early murals at the city .

 <unk> rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at <unk> . According to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrated at <unk> and <unk> , in the core of the Maya <unk> . 
 <unk> may have benefited from the collapse of the large <unk> states such as El <unk> . In the Early Classic <unk> rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , <unk> the development of other nearby Maya cities . 
 The site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of <unk> and conflict with other Maya states , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by <unk> , which rose to take <unk> 's place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands . The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between <unk> and its neighbor <unk> , with <unk> recording the capture of prisoners from <unk> . 
 There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317 , when Lady <unk> <unk> conducted a <unk> @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city .

 The fourteenth king of <unk> was <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak ( Great Jaguar <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis . Little is known about <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak except that he was killed on 14 January <unk> AD . On the same day , <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ ( Fire Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passed through El Peru , a site to the west of <unk> , on 8 January . On Stela 31 he is named as " Lord of the West " . <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non @-@ Maya <unk> of a <unk> combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico . <unk> Owl may even have been the ruler of <unk> . These recorded events strongly suggest that <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ led a <unk> invasion that defeated the native <unk> king , who was captured and immediately executed . <unk> K <unk> ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at <unk> itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of <unk> natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex . He also exerted control over other cities in the area , including <unk> , where he became king , but did not take the throne of <unk> for himself . Within a year , the son of <unk> Owl by the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> I ( First Crocodile ) had been installed as the tenth king of <unk> while he was still a boy , being enthroned on 13 September <unk> . He reigned for 47 years as king of <unk> , and remained a vassal of <unk> K <unk> ' for as long as the latter lived . It seems likely that <unk> <unk> <unk> I took a wife from the <unk> , defeated , <unk> dynasty and thus <unk> the right to rule of his son , <unk> Chan K 'awiil II . 
 <unk> <unk> , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast of <unk> , was conquered by the latter during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The site became an outpost of <unk> , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the Caribbean . 
 Although the new rulers of <unk> were foreign , their descendants were rapidly <unk> . <unk> became the key ally and trading partner of <unk> in the Maya lowlands . After being conquered by <unk> , <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> . <unk> , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into <unk> 's kingdom . Other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> de San José near Lake <unk> <unk> became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north . By the middle of the 5th century <unk> had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction . 
 Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of <unk> 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of <unk> lying to the east and west of the city . Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . These defenses protected <unk> 's core population and agricultural resources , <unk> an area of approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .

 In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as <unk> , whose founder K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' was clearly connected with <unk> . <unk> itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of <unk> . K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' arrived in <unk> in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at <unk> . An individual known as <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' ( lord K <unk> ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at <unk> and may well be the same person . His tomb had <unk> characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior <unk> of <unk> . <unk> texts refer to him as " Lord of the West " , much like <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , <unk> founded the nearby site of <unk> , possibly sponsored by <unk> itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three centuries . 
 A long @-@ running rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began in the 6th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile <unk> <unk> against each other in what has been likened to a long @-@ running war between two Maya <unk> . The kings of these two capitals adopted the title <unk> ' , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to " high king " . 
 The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of <unk> " , who was very likely a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II . She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers . The first of these was <unk> ' B <unk> , who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence . The Lady of <unk> herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . It appears she was later paired with lord " Bird Claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler . .

 In the mid 6th century , <unk> seems to have allied with <unk> and defeated <unk> , closing the Early Classic . The " <unk> hiatus " refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at <unk> . In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis <unk> the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at <unk> was long unexplained until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of <unk> and the <unk> polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of <unk> . The badly eroded Altar 21 at <unk> described how <unk> suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that <unk> was an ally of <unk> in the wider conflict between that city and <unk> , with the defeat of <unk> having a lasting impact upon the city . <unk> was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . After its great victory , <unk> grew rapidly and some of <unk> 's population may have been forcibly relocated there . During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of <unk> took refuge with <unk> ' <unk> of Palenque , another of <unk> 's victims . <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period . 
 The beginning of the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly <unk> the Classic period of <unk> chronology into the Early and Late Classic .

 In <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> , some 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the <unk> River . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four , in 635 , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of <unk> . Roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was attacked by <unk> and was soundly defeated . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was captured by the king of <unk> but , instead of being sacrificed , he was re @-@ instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked <unk> in <unk> , forcing <unk> <unk> Chaak , the then king of <unk> , to temporarily abandon the city . The first two rulers of <unk> <unk> continued to use the <unk> emblem glyph of <unk> , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of <unk> itself . For some reason , B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of <unk> ; instead he stayed at <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> in <unk> , driving B <unk> Chan K 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years . <unk> tried to encircle <unk> within an area dominated by its allies , such as El Peru , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . 
 In 682 , <unk> Chan K 'awiil I erected the first dated monument at <unk> in 120 years and claimed the title of <unk> ' , so ending the hiatus . He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on <unk> when , in <unk> , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . After this , <unk> never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory .

 By the 7th century , there was no active <unk> presence at any Maya site and the center of <unk> had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was <unk> style . <unk> Chan K 'awiil I and his heir <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around <unk> , extending as far as the territory around Lake <unk> <unk> . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . 
 In 738 , <unk> , a vassal of <unk> , <unk> 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to <unk> , defeated <unk> and gained its own independence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of <unk> to bring about the collapse of <unk> 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of <unk> . 
 In the 8th century , the rulers of <unk> collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis . By the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at <unk> slowed . <unk> architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . 
 
 = = = Terminal Classic = = = 
 
 By the 9th century , the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations <unk> and city after city falling into silence . Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . Construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of Temple 3 , the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K <unk> in <unk> . The beginning of the 10th <unk> <unk> in 830 passed <unk> , and marks the beginning of a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city . During this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under <unk> 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph , with <unk> apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence . In <unk> , <unk> K 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at <unk> as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of <unk> but he is not recorded elsewhere and <unk> 's once great power was little more than a memory . The sites of <unk> and <unk> had by now inherited the once exclusive <unk> emblem glyph . 
 As <unk> and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered <unk> , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . <unk> and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . There is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic , although an influx of refugees from the <unk> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . 
 In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of <unk> , as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in <unk> . This was the last monument erected at <unk> before the city finally fell into silence . The former satellites of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , did not last much longer , <unk> their final monuments in <unk> . By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of <unk> 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial <unk> . The squatters blocked some <unk> in the rooms they <unk> in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical instruments . These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them . Some monuments were <unk> and some were moved to new locations . Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for <unk> and the easier to find tombs being looted . After 950 , <unk> was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in <unk> <unk> interspersed among the ruins . Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the <unk> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years . Some of <unk> 's population may have migrated to the <unk> Lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a <unk> in population levels in the first half of the 9th century . 
 The most likely cause of collapse at <unk> is <unk> and agrarian failure . The fall of <unk> was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . However , new research regarding <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of <unk> .

 In <unk> , the Spanish <unk> Hernán Cortés passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of <unk> but did not mention them in his letters . After Spanish friar <unk> de <unk> became lost in the <unk> forests in early <unk> he described a ruin that may well have been <unk> . 
 As is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region . It seems that local people never <unk> about <unk> and they guided <unk> expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s . Some second- or third @-@ hand accounts of <unk> appeared in print starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century ( Stephens and his illustrator Frederick <unk> heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their 1839 @-@ 40 travels in the region ) . Because of the site 's <unk> from modern towns , however , no explorers visited <unk> until <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , respectively the commissioner and the governor of <unk> , visited it in 1848 . Artist <unk> <unk> accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853 . Several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph <unk> in the 19th century ( including Alfred P. <unk> in 1881 @-@ 82 ) and the early 20th century . <unk> archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s . 
 In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the <unk> project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania <unk> Project . They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . Excavations directed by Edwin M. <unk> and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969 . The <unk> Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site . In 1979 , the <unk> government began a further archeological project at <unk> , which continued through to 1984 . 
 <unk> George Lucas used <unk> as a filming location for the first Star Wars film , Episode IV : A New Hope , released in 1977 . Temple I at <unk> was featured on the reverse of the 50 <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park . A site museum has been built at <unk> ; it was completed in 1964 .

 <unk> has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala . It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas . The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors . There are also seven courts for playing the <unk> <unk> , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in <unk> . 
 The limestone used for construction was local and <unk> on @-@ site . The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to <unk> them and were used as reservoirs , together with some <unk> natural depressions . The main <unk> were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that <unk> rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . 
 The residential area of <unk> covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. <unk> and Donald <unk> in the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart . The 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) . Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 in the surrounding area . Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is <unk> as a defensive feature . In addition , some parts of the <unk> were integrated into a canal system . The <unk> of <unk> varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and <unk> than originally thought .

 By the Late Classic , a network of <unk> ( <unk> ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the <unk> ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) . These broad <unk> were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams . 
 The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas @-@ relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic . 
 The <unk> Causeway runs 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) northeast from Temple IV to Group H.

 The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple @-@ pyramids . On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis . 
 The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza . 
 The North Acropolis , together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the <unk> Project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . It is a complex group with construction beginning in the <unk> Period , around 350 BC . It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view . Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate <unk> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the <unk> Period . 
 The South Acropolis is found next to Temple V. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis . It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . 
 The Mundo <unk> is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the <unk> period at <unk> . The complex was organized as a large E @-@ Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples . The Mundo <unk> complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of <unk> in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the <unk> @-@ <unk> form . During the Early Classic period ( c . 250 – 600 ) the Mundo <unk> became one of the twin <unk> of the city , the other being the North Acropolis . From AD 250 to <unk> it may have served as the royal necropolis . The Mundo <unk> complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it . 
 Group G lies just south of the <unk> Causeway . The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @-@ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at <unk> . It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers . The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey . One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask . 
 Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza . It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic . 
 There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid <unk> at <unk> , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have <unk> on all four sides . A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly <unk> from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine <unk> . The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k <unk> ) intervals during the Late Classic . The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to <unk> but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> , and they may reflect the extent of <unk> 's political dominance in the Late Classic . 
 Group Q is a twin @-@ pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at <unk> . It was built by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in <unk> in order to mark the end of the 17th K <unk> . Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re @-@ erected . 
 Group R is another twin @-@ pyramid complex , dated to 790 . It is close to the Maler Causeway .

 There are thousands of ancient structures at <unk> and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work . The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their <unk> . Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high . They were numbered <unk> during the early survey of the site . It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years . 
 Temple I ( also known as the Temple of <unk> <unk> or Temple of the Great Jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to <unk> Chan K <unk> , who was <unk> in the structure in AD <unk> , the pyramid was completed around 740 – 750 . The temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft ) high . The massive <unk> that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives . The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey <unk> of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 . Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with <unk> , as well as <unk> and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink . The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> fashioned from multiple beams . The outermost <unk> is plain but the two inner <unk> were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in Europe . 
 Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high . Like other major temples at <unk> , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> , only the middle of which was carved . The temple was dedicated to the wife of <unk> Chan K <unk> , although no tomb was found . The queen 's portrait was carved into the <unk> spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . One of the beams from this <unk> is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York . 
 Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at <unk> . It stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof <unk> , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD <unk> . The temple shrine possesses two chambers . 
 Temple IV is the tallest temple @-@ pyramid at <unk> , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . Temple IV marks the reign of <unk> ’ in Chan <unk> ( Ruler B , the son of Ruler A or <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ) and two carved wooden <unk> over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @.@ 15 @.@ 10 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE <unk> ( <unk> 1994 : 169 ) . Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at <unk> may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at El <unk> . 
 Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler . The temple stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at <unk> - only Temple IV is taller . The temple has been dated to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via <unk> analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the second half of the 7th century . 
 Temple VI is also known as the Temple of the <unk> and was dedicated in AD <unk> . It is notable for its 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high roof @-@ comb . <unk> of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof @-@ comb . The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is <unk> . 
 Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ( known as <unk> 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( <unk> 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( <unk> 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building . The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall . The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . 
 Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II over the tomb of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid complex . It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry <unk> and three <unk> , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a <unk> @-@ <unk> platform profile , modified from the original style found at <unk> . In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer <unk> with El <unk> and <unk> than with <unk> itself . The vertical <unk> panels are set between sloping <unk> panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . Large flower symbols are set into the sloping <unk> panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at <unk> . The roof of the structure was decorated with <unk> although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . The second head possesses a <unk> tongue but is probably not that of a snake . The temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of <unk> <unk> Chaak or that of his son <unk> Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 49 possesses a clear <unk> @-@ linked architectural style ; it has <unk> , an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region , and a <unk> @-@ <unk> façade ; it dates to the 4th century AD . It is located near to the Lost World pyramid . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 53 is a small <unk> @-@ style platform that dates to about AD 600 . It had <unk> on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure . 
 The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure <unk> @-@ 54 ) is the largest structure in the Mundo <unk> complex . It lies in the southwest portion of <unk> ’ s central core , south of Temple III and west of Temple V. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late <unk> ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un @-@ impacted by later building activity at <unk> . By the end of the Late <unk> this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region . It attained its final form during the reign of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak in the 4th century AD , in the Early Classic , standing more than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high with <unk> on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from <unk> materials . Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex <unk> to the layout that defines the so @-@ called E @-@ Groups , identified as solar observatories . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 96 is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull @-@ and @-@ <unk> motifs . 
 Group <unk> @-@ 16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated . It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks , <unk> murals , relief sculptures and buildings with <unk> characteristics . 
 The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis . 
 The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III . It has two <unk> , with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey , which has been restored . The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows . 
 Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III . The complex dates to AD 711 .

 Altar 5 is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . Altar 5 was found in Complex N , which lies to the west of Temple III . 
 Altar 8 is sculpted with a bound captive . It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Altar 9 is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . It is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Altar 10 is carved with a captive tied to a <unk> . It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion . 
 Altar 35 is a plain monument associated with Stela 43 . The stela @-@ altar pair is <unk> located at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

 = = = Stelae = = = 
 
 Stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . A selection of the most notable stelae at <unk> follows : 
 Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in a standing position . 
 Stela 4 is dated to AD <unk> , during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> after the intrusion of <unk> in the Maya area . The stela displays a mix of Maya and <unk> qualities , and deities from both cultures . It has a portrait of the king with the <unk> Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican <unk> under the other . His helmet is a simplified version of the <unk> War <unk> . Unusually for Maya sculpture , but typically for <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> is depicted with a frontal face , rather than in profile . 
 Stela 5 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . 
 Stela 6 is a badly damaged monument dating to <unk> and bears the name of the " Lady of <unk> " who celebrated the end of the 4th K <unk> in that year . 
 Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged . It described the accession of <unk> ' B <unk> in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument . 
 Stela 11 was the last monument ever erected at <unk> ; it was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II . 
 Stela 12 is linked to the queen known as the " Lady of <unk> " and king <unk> ' B <unk> . The queen is described as performing the year @-@ ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king . 
 Stela 16 was dedicated in 711 , during the reign of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. The sculpture , including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face of the monument . It was found in Complex N , west of Temple III . 
 Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by <unk> <unk> <unk> I to celebrate the k <unk> @-@ ending of AD <unk> . It was re @-@ erected at the base of Temple 34 , his funerary shrine . 
 Stela 19 was dedicated in 790 by <unk> <unk> <unk> II . 
 Stela 20 was found in Complex P , in Group H , and was moved to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Stela 21 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . Only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having been <unk> in ancient times . The surviving sculpture is of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Stela 22 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex . The face of the figure on the stela has been <unk> . 
 Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re @-@ erected in a residential complex . The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so @-@ called " Lady of <unk> " , a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co @-@ rulers . It dates to the early 6th century . 
 Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in <unk> , accompanied by Altar 7 . Both were broken into fragments in ancient times , although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments . 
 Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34 , underneath a broken masonry altar . The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the Late Classic . Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine . 
 Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @.@ 12 @.@ 14 @.@ 8 @.@ 15 ) date equivalent to AD <unk> , the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands . The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the <unk> emblem glyph . It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city . The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959 . 
 Stela 30 is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus . Its style and iconography is similar to that of <unk> , one of the more important of <unk> 's enemies . 
 Stela 31 is the accession monument of <unk> Chan K 'awiil II , also bearing two portraits of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> , as a youth dressed as a <unk> warrior . He carries a <unk> in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of <unk> , the <unk> war god . In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and <unk> buried . Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at <unk> . A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument , the longest to survive from the Early Classic , which describes the arrival of <unk> K <unk> ' at El Peru and <unk> in January <unk> . It was also the first stela at <unk> to be carved on all four faces . 
 Stela 32 is a fragmented monument with a foreign <unk> @-@ style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god <unk> , including his <unk> eyes and <unk> headdress . 
 Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex . The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand . He is <unk> the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive . The monument is dated to AD <unk> . The text on the back of the monument describes a <unk> ritual to celebrate a <unk> @-@ ending . The stela also names <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak I 's father as K 'inich <unk> <unk> . 
 Stela 40 bears a portrait of Kan <unk> and dates to AD 468 . 
 Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35 . It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

 <unk> 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex . A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three @-@ dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two @-@ dimensional body painted on the <unk> . 
 <unk> 10 is the tomb of <unk> <unk> <unk> . It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also <unk> with the deceased king . <unk> in the tomb were <unk> and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and <unk> styles . Among the offerings was an incense @-@ <unk> in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a <unk> vault , then the pyramid was built on top . 
 <unk> 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of <unk> Chan K <unk> . It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two <unk> who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its <unk> and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact . 
 <unk> 85 dates to the Late <unk> and was enclosed by a platform , with a primitive <unk> vault . The tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its <unk> . The dynastic founder of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ' Xook , has been linked to this tomb , which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis . The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being <unk> by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers . The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle . The missing head was replaced by a small <unk> mask with shell @-@ <unk> teeth and eyes and bearing a three @-@ pointed royal <unk> . This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare <unk> lowland Maya portrait of a king . Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine , a <unk> shell and twenty @-@ six ceramic vessels . 
 <unk> 116 is the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the Great Plaza . The tomb contained rich offerings of <unk> , ceramics , shell and works of art . The body of the king was covered with large quantities of <unk> ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king . One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate <unk> mosaic vessel with the <unk> bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself . 
 <unk> 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely <unk> away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving <unk> in the dried mud . Archaeologists filled these <unk> with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone . 
 <unk> 196 is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a <unk> mosaic vessel topped with the head of the <unk> God . 
 
 
 = Tropical Storm <unk> ( 2008 ) = 
 
 Tropical Storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . <unk> developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> around noon the same day . Over the next several days , <unk> moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression . <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of <unk> on September 10 . However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix .

 Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 . It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands . As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . 
 <unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
 <unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . 
 Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> . The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as <unk> continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted . However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again . By the afternoon , the center of <unk> was only a <unk> of clouds , devoid of convection . During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with <unk> began to <unk> somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong <unk> wind shear . By mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on <unk> by late morning . The convection around the system became <unk> from the center and <unk> weakened slightly . 
 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status . <unk> regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . 
 However , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of <unk> headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . 
 
 = = Impact = = 
 
 As <unk> passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) . There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
 Several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) of rain fell . The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . No known damage was caused by the flood .

 Mount <unk> is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin . The ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @.@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak in the <unk> Range and the second @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney . Mount <unk> is located in San Isabel National Forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) of the City of <unk> in Lake County , Colorado . 
 The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 . Henry W. <unk> of the <unk> Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in <unk> <unk> . Mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains .

 Mount <unk> is visible to the southwest of <unk> , often snow @-@ capped even in the summer . Many other <unk> surround <unk> in all directions , and it is very close to central Colorado 's Collegiate <unk> . The neighboring Mount Massive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third @-@ highest in the contiguous United States , and La Plata Peak , to the south , is the fifth @-@ highest in the Rockies . The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount <unk> , Denver is about 130 miles ( <unk> km ) to the east , <unk> is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and <unk> is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west . <unk> , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town . <unk> 's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California . Including Alaska and Hawaii , Mount <unk> is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain in the United States . 
 Weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the <unk> ; <unk> and snow are possible year @-@ round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science .

 Mount <unk> is part of the <unk> Range , an <unk> of the Laramide <unk> which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago . The tops of this range were heavily <unk> , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues . For example , the base of <unk> on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and <unk> rocks deposited when the glaciers <unk> , which lie on a lateral <unk> . Further up the eastern side there is a large <unk> with a small <unk> . There are also lakes to both the north and south , <unk> and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and <unk> Lake was created by the <unk> Sugar <unk> Dam . 
 Mount <unk> is composed largely of <unk> . However , the summit ridge consists of <unk> basement rock , which is Pre @-@ <unk> in origin and about 1 @.@ 7 billion years old . There are various igneous <unk> including <unk> , as well as " bands " of <unk> and <unk> . Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , <unk> lacks both a permanent <unk> and a prominent north @-@ facing <unk> , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Mount <unk> was named by miners in honor of Samuel <unk> <unk> , the governor of the then @-@ Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the <unk> tribe that opened up more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was by <unk> <unk> in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the <unk> Survey . 
 Originally measured as 14 @,@ <unk> feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m ) in height , Mount <unk> 's elevation was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) following a re @-@ evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests . The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American <unk> <unk> of 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level <unk> of 1929 . A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of <unk> and its neighbor , Mount Massive , which differ in elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount <unk> proponents <unk> them . The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount <unk> has remained the highest peak in Colorado . The first <unk> ascent of <unk> occurred in 1949 , when a Jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development .

 The summit of Mount <unk> is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as <unk> <unk> ( sky @-@ pilot ) , <unk> <unk> ( old @-@ man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mountain ) , and <unk> <unk> ( alpine <unk> ) . Also noted are <unk> <unk> var. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> album , <unk> <unk> var. <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . Below <unk> the mountain is heavily forested , with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine , spruce , <unk> and fir . 
 Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears , <unk> , mule deer , <unk> , and pocket <unk> ; there are also many species of <unk> . Elk , grouse , turkey and <unk> sheep are present in the area during the summer .

 There are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of elevation . The standard route <unk> the peak from the east , starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes . The 4 @.@ 6 miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) long North ( Main ) <unk> Trail begins close to the <unk> Creek <unk> , and gains about 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) . The trail is open to <unk> , mountain <unk> and hunters during season . An easier , but longer route , the South <unk> Trail , is 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) long , climbing 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) at a less @-@ punishing gradient than the North <unk> Trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge . 
 The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail , a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub @-@ peak , South <unk> , at 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) . Even healthy and experienced <unk> report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places . The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ascent . There are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from South <unk> Creek <unk> and Echo Canyon <unk> respectively . 
 Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock climbing . The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness . This can affect anyone , even those who are <unk> . In serious cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude pulmonary <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , <unk> , and death . <unk> are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes . Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , Anna Elizabeth Dickinson , the <unk> , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government . 
 
 
 = Scientology in Germany = 
 
 The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970 . German authorities estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active Scientologists in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology has encountered particular <unk> from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in Germany . 
 German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or <unk> community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities . The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion . It views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution . This stance has been criticized , most notably by the U.S. government , which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . 
 Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions . They are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so @-@ called " sect <unk> " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . Despite this , polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . Its stated <unk> aim is to " clear the planet " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . Scientology teaches that the source of people 's <unk> lies in " <unk> " , psychological <unk> acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of <unk> called " <unk> " made available by the Church of Scientology . 
 The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for <unk> and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with governments <unk> it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that Scientology is " a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , totalitarian ideology with world @-@ dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses . Scientology has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . These efforts have been partly successful – Scientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993 , and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights , which <unk> Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion . 
 The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion , but a " commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany 's democratic society " . Accordingly , the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France , the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium , Greece and the UK . 
 On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " <unk> and totalitarian practices " . Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . <unk> in Scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an " <unk> political movement " . 
 To further justify its stance , the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology , including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies , <unk> and the theft of government documents , a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a " <unk> environment " , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a Scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .

 Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970 . By 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " Scientology Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " Scientology <unk> " ) in Germany . The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities – Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , Düsseldorf , Frankfurt am Main , Hanover and <unk> . Of the Scientology <unk> , nine are in Baden @-@ <unk> , and three in <unk> . Following German re @-@ unification , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and North @-@ Rhine <unk> . 
 Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or <unk> in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . <unk> in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of <unk> bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . 
 Scientology formulated a " <unk> Germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> society in which Scientology enjoys <unk> influence . The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on <unk> Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> Germany " programme is still being pursued . 
 
 = = = Public opposition = = = 
 
 German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion , but generally <unk> it as a <unk> ( cult or sect ) , or as an <unk> profit @-@ making venture preying on vulnerable minds . Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions " such as the <unk> Church , <unk> , Children of God , and the Divine Light Mission . The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( <unk> ) of Germany 's Protestant Churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private " initiatives of parents and concerned persons " . <unk> <unk> ( " Educational Information Campaign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with Scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its <unk> in public places , and published an influential book , The <unk> of Scientology and its Front <unk> . In 1981 , the organization 's founder , <unk> <unk> , became the director of <unk> für <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " Campaign for <unk> and <unk> Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult organization . <unk> from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious <unk> , the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979 . 
 <unk> by events such as the <unk> Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple , and the 1995 <unk> <unk> incidents in Japan , German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with Scientology attracting particular attention . <unk> that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert <unk> Young , an American ex @-@ Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der <unk> , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a <unk> – the <unk> Project Force – for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty of <unk> . From the mid @-@ 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience . 
 As noted by the religious scholar Hubert <unk> , Scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state " . This view of Scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter of political <unk> " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social <unk> . Stephen A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses . " Officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " <unk> to a democratic state " . Federal <unk> and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology . 
 Government publications on the dangers of <unk> increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology . The German courts had approved such publications in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . In 1996 , the German parliament launched an <unk> ( <unk> ) Commission to investigate <unk> and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology . Its final report , published in June 1998 , concluded that Scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by Germany 's domestic intelligence services . 
 An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged " infiltration " of businesses by Scientologists , in line with Scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination . Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium @-@ size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management @-@ training companies . Management @-@ consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients ' upper management , these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used . An expensive commercial version of Scientology 's Oxford <unk> Analysis , usually offered free as part of Scientology <unk> in public places , temporarily entered some major German companies ( who were unaware of its <unk> ) via such a management @-@ consultancy firm . 
 In the mid @-@ 2000s , German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after @-@ school <unk> market . These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after @-@ school <unk> centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt , Hamburg , <unk> and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists , using Scientology methods . <unk> advertising the <unk> services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , but not Scientology itself . 
 In early 2008 , Thomas <unk> , <unk> Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and <unk> , and the historian <unk> Knopp both likened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister . <unk> and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which <unk> and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience 's response to Goebbels ' famous question , " Do you want total war ? " <unk> 's and Knopp 's comments found few critics in Germany . Most Germans consider Scientology a <unk> organization . In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans favoured banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der <unk> found 67 % support for a ban . 
 German scholars such as <unk> <unk> and Gerald <unk> have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying <unk> . In <unk> 's words , this includes both the " efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong @-@ <unk> statements " and " Scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution " ; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany , she adds that " the American press may prefer <unk> news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes " . Both <unk> and <unk> assert that the situation is compounded by the general <unk> of scientific studies of Scientology . <unk> as well as Irving <unk> , Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars . <unk> attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate . 
 In 2010 a German public broadcaster , <unk> , showed the film Until Nothing Remains , a <unk> account of the effect Scientology had on one German family . Said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 @.@ 69 million . 
 
 = = Legal status = = 
 
 While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned , the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there . Its precise legal status however is unresolved . Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a " religion or <unk> " ( Religion or <unk> ; these are equal before German law ) , and <unk> , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a " religious or <unk> community " ( <unk> oder <unk> ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and <unk> . Status as a " religious or <unk> community " also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . 
 The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or <unk> community . The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a <unk> community . In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @-@ <unk> in <unk> said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @.@ 1 of the German Constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and <unk> <unk> . 
 Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or <unk> community and asserts that Scientology is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a religion . Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public .

 Given the history of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution . The <unk> domestic intelligence service ( <unk> für <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997 , as have the <unk> for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German <unk> . Minister for Family Policy <unk> <unk> instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal . 
 The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid <unk> . The court ruled that the use of <unk> was <unk> . In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . 
 At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the <unk> in November 2004 . The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology , as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the German constitution . <unk> acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti @-@ Scientology legislation . <unk> counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany . The court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the <unk> of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . 
 In <unk> , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 , because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the <unk> after the North Rhine @-@ <unk> Higher Administrative Court in <unk> refused to hear an appeal on the matter . Being suspected of maintaining " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its <unk> . 
 There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government , charging him with " carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and <unk> identity documents " . The German government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence for <unk> on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident .

 A " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration " ( <unk> ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect <unk> , primarily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " <unk> commissioner 's " offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government . 
 A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the <unk> – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter " S " . Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some <unk> have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . 
 Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in <unk> are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in <unk> . Companies <unk> for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists ; in 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract " . When it became known that Microsoft 's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk <unk> developed by Executive Software International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . To <unk> these concerns , Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility . Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German <unk> to cease the use of protective declarations . 
 The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing Scientology , the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the leadership of <unk> <unk> . In 2005 , in a case brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not <unk> with court instructions banning the use of " sect <unk> . " Internet links to sample <unk> to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . <unk> Barker , a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that " Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in <unk> the civil rights of Scientologists . " The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; <unk> moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on Scientology . 
 Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union , the Christian Social Union of <unk> , the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party . <unk> Scientologist members of these parties have been " purged " , according to Time Magazine . Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany ; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . In 1995 , a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L. Ron Hubbard and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist management and communication consultancy firm . Thomas <unk> , a German TV presenter , was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in Scientology courses ; <unk> responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would <unk> cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology . In 2007 , Günther <unk> , the Minister @-@ President of the German state of Baden @-@ <unk> , expressed concern that Scientologist John <unk> was to appear on <unk> 's programme , and asked the <unk> TV station to consider <unk> the invitation ; the <unk> said that <unk> <unk> would cause greater damage , and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme . 
 In 2010 , the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that a woman working in a children 's <unk> centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex @-@ husband identified her as a Scientologist , should be reinstated . The woman had demonstrated to the court 's satisfaction that her <unk> beliefs were irrelevant to her work . According to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children 's parents of her membership in Scientology .

 In March 2007 , it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin . On December 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti @-@ constitutional goals , <unk> " essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked Germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . 
 The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the German interior ministers ' evaluation was based on " a few sentences out of 500 @,@ 000 pages of <unk> literature " . She added , " I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn 't mean I will demand the ban of Christianity . " 
 In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . The report by the <unk> cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German <unk> , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the United States . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution . Here , the report found that Scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order . " Neither its <unk> nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " . The <unk> also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . 
 Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , Berlin 's interior minister , said , " This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . But they put very little of this into practice . The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a <unk> organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . " The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " . <unk> of Scientology 's activities by the German intelligence services continues . 
 In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning <unk> @-@ by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin @-@ <unk> which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists ' basic religious rights . 
 
 = = Criticism of Germany 's stance = = 
 
 The United States media , while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany . Richard Cohen for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : " Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German reaction to it is <unk> still – not to mention disturbing . " Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that Scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the Nazi party , from <unk> beginnings " – was itself <unk> of " the Nazi era 's <unk> " . 
 The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect <unk> . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt religion in the United States . That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid <unk> . The State Department 's 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . " Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John <unk> , as well as jazz pianist Chick <unk> . 
 Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ Chancellor <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies <unk> by Germany in the 1930s . The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer <unk> Fields , whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie <unk> , director Oliver Stone , writers Mario <unk> and <unk> Vidal and talk @-@ show host Larry King . It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington . 
 U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology , saying , " We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government . " Chancellor <unk> , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know . " German officials argued that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion . This is <unk> , pure and simple . " Officials explained that precisely because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , including right @-@ wing Nazi groups " , and not just against Scientology . <unk> 's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited German court <unk> stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> of oppression " . 
 In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted <unk> to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . In April 1997 , John <unk> met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . <unk> later said Clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with Scientology " . According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it " , stating that Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " . In September 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be " the administration 's Scientology point person " . The German ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany 's basic political principles . " 
 A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . However , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era . 
 In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the <unk> case . It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she applied for <unk> . On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an " orchestrated effort " by Scientology undertaken " for political gain " , and " a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system " . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a " hate campaign " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists " and maintained that Scientologists had not " exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States . " Mark <unk> , a ( former ) top Church of Scientology official , said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case , " there would have been nothing improper if it had . " 
 In 2003 , Joachim <unk> , writing in the Swiss <unk> <unk> Zeitung , noted that <unk> <unk> , a German Christian theologian , director of the Hannah <unk> Institute for Research into <unk> in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his <unk> of religious freedom , had been pressured to <unk> publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology . <unk> concluded that " <unk> " had " triumphed " over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany 's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter . 
 The U.S. Department of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of Scientology remains in <unk> . The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion . Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members . Four of the major political parties ( the Christian Democratic Union , Christian Social Union , Social Democratic Party , and Free Democratic Party ) ban Scientologists from party membership . [ ... ] Scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination . Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so @-@ called ' sect <unk> ' to <unk> and boycott Scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector . ' <unk> <unk> ' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines . [ ... ] Catholic and Protestant churches continued to oppose Scientology <unk> [ sic ] , although press reporting and public reactions to Scientology decreased . Several private organizations issued warnings about after @-@ school study programs run by Scientologists . "

 = Japanese battleship Asahi = 
 
 Asahi ( <unk> , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom . Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet , the <unk> 's primary combat fleet . She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of <unk> . Asahi saw no combat during World War I , although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918 . 
 <unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May . She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her crew survived . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Combat experience in the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <unk> École naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships . Therefore , Japan promulgated a ten @-@ year naval build @-@ up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core . These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War . As with the earlier Fuji and <unk> classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme . Asahi , the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain , was ordered from the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Company shipyard in <unk> , Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme . 
 
 = = Design and description = = 
 
 Asahi 's design was a modified version of the <unk> @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy , with two additional 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . The ship had an overall length of 425 feet 3 inches ( 129 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 75 feet ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) , and a normal draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 15 @,@ 200 long tons ( 15 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . Asahi had a complete double bottom with 55 <unk> compartments . Her hull was also subdivided into 223 <unk> compartments . She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about <unk> officers and enlisted men , including the admiral 's staff . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines built by <unk> , Tennant , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 17 @.@ 03 bar ( 1 @,@ 703 <unk> ; 247 <unk> ) . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) although Asahi reached 18 @.@ 3 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 mph ) from 16 @,@ <unk> indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 181 kW ) during her sea trials on 23 March 1900 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 9 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 000 km ; 10 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was fitted with three steam @-@ driven 4 @.@ 8 @-@ <unk> ( 6 @.@ 4 hp ) <unk> . 
 Asahi 's main battery consisted of the same four <unk> Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns used in all of Japan 's preceding battleships . They were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The <unk> powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of + 13 @.@ 5 ° . Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 730 m / s ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 45 @-@ calibre 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns mounted in casemates . Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure . They fired 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) . Protection against torpedo @-@ boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns . The 12 @-@ pounders fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) . <unk> guns consisted of eight 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) three @-@ pounder <unk> guns and four 47 @-@ millimetre 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder <unk> guns . The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the fighting tops . The three @-@ pounder gun fired 3 @.@ 19 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 45 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) , while the 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder fired 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) . The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . 
 The waterline main belt of Asahi consisted of Harvey armour 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 44 m ) high , of which 3 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 11 m ) was above the waterline at normal load , and had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( <unk> mm ) for the middle 224 feet ( 68 @.@ 28 m ) of the ship . It was only 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six @-@ inch <unk> of armour that ran between the barbettes . The barbettes were 14 inches ( <unk> mm ) thick , but only 10 inches ( 254 mm ) behind the upper armour <unk> . The barbette <unk> were protected by 10 inches of armour on their face while their sides were 6 inches thick and the roof was 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . <unk> bulkheads connecting the barbettes to the side armour were 12 – 14 inches thick , but only 6 inches thick at the lower deck level . The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also 6 inches thick with the rear protected by 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) armour plates . The flat portion of the deck armour was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship . The conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour . 
 Asahi , like all the other Japanese battleships of the time , was fitted with four <unk> and Stroud <unk> coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) . The ships were also fitted with 24 @-@ power <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 
 Asahi , meaning " rising sun " , a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of <unk> poetry , was laid down on 1 August 1898 in <unk> , Scotland , by the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and completed by John Brown & Company , which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed . She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900 . Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off <unk> following sea trials . The ship departed England , after repairs in Portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at <unk> , Japan , on 23 October 1900 . Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re @-@ formed on 28 December 1903 . 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . <unk> had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser <unk> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . <unk> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . <unk> his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before <unk> <unk> . Asahi was not hit during the engagement . 
 The ship participated in the action of 13 April , when <unk> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> 's flagship , the battleship <unk> . When <unk> spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and <unk> struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and <unk> was one of the <unk> killed . <unk> by his success , <unk> resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , prompting the Russians to lay more minefields , which sank two Japanese battleships the following month . 
 During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , Asahi , now commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships , behind <unk> , and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships . She was only hit by a single 12 @-@ inch shell that wounded two crewmen . Both guns in her aft 12 @-@ inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels . In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships <unk> and <unk> although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact . The ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two of her 12 @-@ inch shells struck the bridge of <unk> , killing the Russian squadron commander , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , two of his staff officers and the ship 's <unk> . The ship 's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion . The second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel <unk> , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur . <unk> more than two months later , on 26 October , Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty . <unk> damaged , she was under repair at <unk> Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905 . Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or <unk> by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May .

 At the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 , Asahi again followed the battleship <unk> into combat , this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons . <unk> opened fire at the battleship <unk> <unk> , the Russian flagship , at 14 : 10 , and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser <unk> shortly afterwards .

The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on <unk> during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time . <unk> was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons . <unk> <unk> 's steering was later repaired , but she <unk> between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged . Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships <unk> and <unk> in the late stages of the battle , although Fuji fired the shots that caused the <unk> 's magazines to explode and sink her . Asahi fired more twelve @-@ inch shells , 142 , than any other ship during the battle . In total , the ship was hit six times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly . While Asahi 's casualties are not precisely known , the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle . The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the <unk> . 
 Captain W. C. <unk> , the Royal Navy 's official military observer under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , took notes of the battle 's progress from a deck chair on Asahi 's exposed quarterdeck . His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West .

 John <unk> <unk> <unk> ( August 5 , 1869 – January 9 , 1940 ) was the 35th Governor of Kentucky and a United States Senator from Kentucky . He was the state 's first popularly elected senator following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment . 
 <unk> from a prominent political family , <unk> was chosen as Democrat William <unk> 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . <unk> lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor , but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results . During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot <unk> . A day later the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give the election to <unk> , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and <unk> over the governorship . <unk> ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state . 
 Following his term as governor , <unk> made a bid to become a U.S. Senator . His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley . Six years later <unk> secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re @-@ election bid largely because of his pro @-@ temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage . Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his <unk> campaign in 1936 . He died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 .

 J. C. W. <unk> was born at <unk> , near <unk> in Nelson County , Kentucky , son of William <unk> and Julia <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> . His maternal grandfather , Charles A. <unk> , was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as <unk> general in the administration of John Tyler . His uncle , Robert C. <unk> , served as governor of Louisiana . 
 <unk> obtained his early education at <unk> Academy in <unk> . In 1881 he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of 12 . Later , he enrolled at Central University ( now Eastern Kentucky University ) in Richmond , Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother . Two years later , he became principal of <unk> public schools , serving from 1888 to 1893 . <unk> , he studied law at the University of Kentucky , where he earned his law degree in 1889 . He was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in <unk> in 1893 . He also served as president of the Young Democrats ' Club of Nelson County .

 <unk> 's political career began in 1894 when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives .

 = = = Governor of Kentucky = = = 
 
 Democrat William <unk> chose <unk> as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . <unk> was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and <unk> 's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate . But friends of <unk> assured him that <unk> would be loyal to <unk> 's reform agenda , whereas the two other men <unk> was considering as running mates would " stack the Senate committees against him . " <unk> was not yet 30 , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection . 
 <unk> lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor . When the General Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 , the election results were immediately challenged . With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . The Assembly was still <unk> on January 30 , 1900 , when <unk> was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . The following day , as <unk> was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give him the election . He was sworn into office from his bed the same day . Three days later <unk> died , never having risen from the bed . 
 Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly 's decision and <unk> the governorship . The Republicans in the legislature <unk> Taylor 's orders , while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership . Finally , on February 21 , 1900 , Taylor and <unk> agreed to let the courts settle the matter . The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court , which found in favor of <unk> . Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state . On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States , which declined to hear the case on May 21 , 1900 . Taylor 's only supporter on the court was <unk> John Marshall <unk> . 
 Following the Supreme Court ruling , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , fearing he would be implicated in <unk> 's assassination . <unk> became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held November 6 , 1900 , to determine who would complete <unk> 's <unk> term . <unk> ( now of age ) won the election over Republican John W. <unk> by fewer than 4 @,@ 000 votes . Shortly following the special election , <unk> married Jean Raphael <unk> of <unk> . The couple had two sons . 
 As governor <unk> sought to unite his party and the state . As part of this effort he supported changes to the <unk> partisan <unk> Election Law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly . He stressed non @-@ controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state 's educational system . He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and <unk> had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . However , his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda . The only major pieces of legislation passed during <unk> 's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state 's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14 to work without their parents ' consent .

 Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , <unk> announced he would seek a full term as governor in 1903 . His candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled <unk> had not served a full first term and was eligible to run . Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non @-@ controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nomination . His record also deprived his Republican opponent , Morris B. <unk> , of any significant campaign issue in the general election . <unk> defeated <unk> and three minor candidates . 
 In his message to the legislature in 1904 , <unk> again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session . During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor <unk> . 
 In March 1904 , <unk> signed the Day Law <unk> racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky . <unk> College , a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals . <unk> appealed to the Supreme Court , and in 1908 the court handed down an 8 – 1 decision against the college . Only John Marshall <unk> <unk> . 
 Near the close of the 1904 session , legislators approved the creation of <unk> County from parts of Carter , Elliott , and Lewis counties . Olive Hill was made the county seat . Soon the county 's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) . Carter County joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of <unk> County passed too close to Grayson , the seat of Carter County , and <unk> , the seat of Lewis County . The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of a county seat . On April 29 , 1904 , the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the <unk> and dissolved <unk> County . 
 During the 1906 legislative session , <unk> urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes . In particular , he recommended reducing the practice of deferred <unk> , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on @-@ hand for illegal purposes . He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky , <unk> the its economy and providing <unk> some protection against fraud . 
 <unk> refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black <unk> Tobacco Wars . He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political – the Democrats were dominant in this region and he didn 't want to challenge his own party . By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government , <unk> virtually eliminated the state 's debt . Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state 's normal schools , Western State Teachers College in <unk> Green ( later Western Kentucky University ) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . 
 With a successful legislative session behind him , <unk> made a bold political move in June 1906 : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and <unk> primaries in November – a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the <unk> election . <unk> wanted the Senate seat , and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor . It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party 's choice of his potential successor as governor . State <unk> Samuel Wilbur <unk> was <unk> 's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over <unk> <unk> <unk> . Former governor James B. <unk> challenged <unk> for the <unk> nomination , but <unk> won by more than 11 @,@ 000 votes .

 <unk> 's term as governor ended December 10 , 1907 . In January 1908 he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the U.S. Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier . The Republicans nominated former governor William O. Bradley . On the first ballot <unk> secured 66 of the needed 69 votes ; Bradley received 64 votes . Seven Democrats had not voted for <unk> . Over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though William Jennings Bryan , the Democratic nominee for president , campaigned for <unk> . Some Democrats pressured <unk> to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run , but he refused . On the 29th ballot , taken near the end of February 1908 , Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him . 
 <unk> 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election . His position put him at odds with Henry <unk> , editor of the powerful Louisville Courier @-@ Journal . As governor <unk> had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville . When the Kentucky Court of Appeals <unk> the results of Louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's " whiskey ring " in May 1907 , <unk> appointed Robert Worth <unk> , a young lawyer and fellow <unk> , as interim mayor until elections could be held in November . <unk> eliminated <unk> in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday . Following this , the whiskey ring announced <unk> had forfeited the support of Louisville 's legislators . In the <unk> election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against <unk> were from Louisville . Following his defeat , <unk> returned to his law practice . 
 Six years later <unk> again attempted to win the Senate seat . Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated Augustus O. Stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressman . The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. <unk> . <unk> by his support of President <unk> Wilson , <unk> won the election by 32 @,@ 000 votes . 
 <unk> served as chairman of the Senate Committee on <unk> in the Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs . In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky , Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox . Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I , Fort Knox became the home of the United States <unk> <unk> . When the United States entered World War I , <unk> continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations . 
 True to his <unk> stance , <unk> supported passage of the <unk> Amendment <unk> the import and sale of alcohol in the United States . The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920 . Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , <unk> opposed the <unk> Amendment , which granted women 's suffrage . The amendment failed on February 10 , 1919 , but passed on June 4 , 1919 . <unk> voted against it both times . 
 The Democrats <unk> <unk> without opposition in 1920 . His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst . Prohibition had destroyed the <unk> industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent <unk> received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox . He was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support of President Wilson , who had lost popularity since <unk> 's election in 1914 . Ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 votes , winning the race with 50 @.@ 3 percent of the vote to <unk> 's 49 @.@ 7 percent . During his single term in the Senate <unk> served alongside three other U.S. Senators from Kentucky : <unk> M. James , George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley . 
 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 
 Following his term in the Senate , <unk> resumed his legal practice in Louisville . He sought another term as governor in 1927 . This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal , which had been purchased by his ally , Robert W. <unk> . He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the <unk> Club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <unk> betting at the state 's horse <unk> . 
 The <unk> Club ran a candidate in both parties ' primary elections . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated the Club 's relatively obscure candidate , Robert T. Crowe . <unk> D. Sampson , the Club 's nominee in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination . In the general election <unk> could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J. Fields , who had been elected with the help of the <unk> Club . Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , <unk> lost to Sampson by more than 32 @,@ 000 votes . It was estimated that the Club spent over $ 500 @,@ 000 to defeat him . 
 <unk> was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . The Democrats turned to A. B. " Happy " Chandler of Henderson , who won the election . <unk> supported Chandler 's bid , and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936 . <unk> also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government <unk> Commission . 
 <unk> attempted to return to the Senate in 1936 . The head of the <unk> Club , James B. Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 . In 1933 <unk> 's ally , Robert <unk> , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , increasing his prominence and influence . <unk> also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller . The race was complicated , though , by the entry of John <unk> Brown , a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives . He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate . However , Chandler threw his support to <unk> , and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of <unk> and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at <unk> 's expense . Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes . 
 <unk> died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 , and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky . <unk> County , Oklahoma , was named in his honor at the suggestion of a <unk> who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma 's constitutional convention in 1907 . <unk> , his birthplace , was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16 , 1973 . 
 
 
 = 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team = 
 
 The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> . The <unk> were the first New Zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black . They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of Victorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia . Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008 . 
 After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez . The Māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " Māori " as they had expected . Playing their first match , on 3 October against Surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . Their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when they won 10 of their 13 matches . The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 . This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team . By January 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable . 
 In a return match on 19 January , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat . The team then went undefeated until 16 February , when they faced England . Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international , during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to England , prompting three of the <unk> to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won 7 – 0 . The <unk> apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . The New Zealanders left England without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . They then returned to New Zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland . 
 The <unk> ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892 . Seventeen of the team 's 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , Thomas <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 The idea for assembling a team of Māori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph <unk> , a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884 . He initially proposed a team of Māori or part @-@ Māori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a Māori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful . <unk> of <unk> 's plans , civil servant Thomas <unk> contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which <unk> accepted . When James Scott , a <unk> , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and <unk> its promoter . 
 <unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 . He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack <unk> due to his university commitments . Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ Māori . Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the " New Zealand <unk> " to the " New Zealand Native Football Representatives " . The final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a <unk> father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown . 
 The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas , playing against <unk> 's Bay , Auckland , Nelson , Wellington , Canterbury , South Canterbury , and <unk> . The first game was contested against <unk> 's Bay in Napier on 23 June 1888 . They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand , and won seven of them . Their last New Zealand match before departure , against <unk> played in <unk> on 31 July 1888 , was won by one try to nil . 
 The team sailed for Australia from <unk> , leaving on 1 August 1888 . In Melbourne , Scott recruited Jack <unk> to train the players in Victorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible Victorian Rules matches on their return to Australia . The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby Union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to Britain via Suez . They arrived in London on 27 September 1888 .

 The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of England 's Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) . The first match of the tour was against Surrey , where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . That the team was predominantly Māori provoked curiosity from the British press – at the time , most Britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " Māori " as had been expected . " They are not unlike Europeans , " a Scottish reporter wrote in November 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " . The Surrey match , which was <unk> by the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , was won 4 – 1 by the <unk> after they scored two tries . 
 The <unk> next defeated both <unk> and Kent , before defeats by <unk> and Burton @-@ on @-@ Trent . Both defeats were unexpected , and in the <unk> match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . The team recovered to win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham . Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , <unk> . The Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould . Middlesex won easily , with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling . The final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders . Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to . A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : 
 The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players , whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . Such " passing " as the Home men displayed the <unk> <unk> admit they have never previously witnessed . Said <unk> whilst we were on the platform waiting for the London train , " I think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . " 
 Following the match against Middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest English rugby teams were based . Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 over the issue of " broken time " payments . The New Zealanders lost to Hull 1 – 0 , defeated <unk> , then lost to Wakefield . After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County ) they defeated Stockton @-@ on @-@ <unk> and <unk> . Joe <unk> appeared in the match against <unk> , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point . These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November . The team then won seven matches in a row , including one against <unk> RFC , their only Scottish opposition of the tour . The last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District . The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them . By this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against <unk> County on 24 November , five had injuries . The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team . 
 
 = = Ireland , further English matches , and Wales = = 
 
 The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 1 December 1888 . Both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection . Ireland led 3 – 0 at half @-@ time after scoring a converted try , but the <unk> improved considerably in the second @-@ half , scoring four tries . Patrick <unk> scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press . The third try scored was by Thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by George Williams . The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory . The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship . Following their defeat of Ireland , the <unk> played Trinity College and then North of Ireland . The match against Trinity College was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite <unk> not playing , the Native side played much better than their previous fixture . The team then travelled to Belfast , where they defeated North of Ireland 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to nil . 
 After returning to England , the <unk> faced Lancashire in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 . Two days later they drew with <unk> Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries . Their next match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season . Yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the <unk> , who scored six tries . After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to <unk> , before facing Wales on 22 December . 
 At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players . Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @-@ man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan <unk> of <unk> had been selected . The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only £ 120 recorded . The crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and <unk> Norman <unk> was " <unk> nervous " at the start of the match . <unk> , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest Welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of Tom <unk> in 2010 . Despite the <unk> aimed primarily at <unk> , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . 
 Towers scored the first Welsh try , which was converted by Jim Webb . The <unk> replied with a spirited run by <unk> , but he failed to break through the Welsh defence . The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a <unk> try <unk> the half @-@ way line , which went some way to silence the <unk> from the crowd . Webb , playing in out of position at full @-@ back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark . The <unk> continued to push , with Elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the try line , and when <unk> did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could touch down . In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim <unk> to score . <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game . 
 The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed . In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward . With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play . 
 Before they left Wales , the <unk> played Swansea and two other local clubs , Newport , and Cardiff . They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales , and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators . They finished their Welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd . 
 
 = = Return to England = = 
 
 The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws . The <unk> ' play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement . The team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England . January started with a 4 – 1 loss to Bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many of them non @-@ paying , in order . This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church , <unk> , <unk> Rangers , and Huddersfield . Following further matches against <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for a second time . 
 Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line @-@ up against the <unk> when the sides first met in December . After the unexpected loss , Yorkshire were determined to make <unk> and a strong side was selected for the county , including Fred <unk> , Richard <unk> and John Willie <unk> , all of whom would appear for England against the <unk> later that season . Described as " knocked about " and " stale " , the <unk> struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to <unk> left the scores at 9 – 1 at half @-@ time . The second @-@ half was little better for the <unk> ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop @-@ goal . The second of these tries was scored by <unk> after he ran the ball from his own half . <unk> scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn 't prevent the <unk> suffering their largest defeat of the tour : 16 – 4 to the <unk> . <unk> later described the match as " without a <unk> , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour " . 
 After a victory over <unk> Valley District , the team travelled west to play <unk> , Devonshire , Taunton , and Gloucestershire , and won all five games . The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders ' largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory . Half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly for the <unk> , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . Devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed . After defeating Midland Counties , the <unk> returned to London . 
 The team had two further matches before their international against England . The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , <unk> . Andrew <unk> , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the <unk> . The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by <unk> . Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players . The <unk> were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy <unk> , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour . 
 
 = = England international = = 
 
 The match against England was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun . The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) . Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the <unk> . The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the <unk> on 16 February 1889 . 
 The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength . Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . The match was <unk> by Rowland Hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match in Britain , against Surrey . The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground . Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal . England took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half . 
 Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English . The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the RFU . <unk> attempted to tackle the English player <unk> , and in the process ripped his shorts off . The <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . While this was happening one of the English players , Frank <unk> , picked up the ball and scored a try . The New Zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called " dead ball " – but Hill awarded the try , prompting three of the Native players , Dick <unk> , Williams , and <unk> <unk> , to leave the field in protest . The <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before Hill had <unk> play . <unk> was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU . <unk> wrote after the tour that " gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game , <unk> , <unk> at all in that game " . The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English , who ultimately won 7 – 0 . 
 The RFU , at Hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' captain of the day , Edward <unk> , who had led the team as Joe <unk> was injured . The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> . <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game : 
 The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' <unk> was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the <unk> , including Joe <unk> , accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to <unk> the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . 
 
 = = Later matches and departure from England = = 
 
 The <unk> remained in London following the England international . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University . From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh . After a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull . <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England . 
 The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their <unk> match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived <unk> from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest . 
 
 = = Australia = = 
 
 The majority of the <unk> left Plymouth on 29 March ( <unk> and Pie <unk> followed a week later ) . They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way . Although the side had employed Jack <unk> to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . 
 The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria . The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory . After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 . After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats . 
 The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . Consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . The <unk> faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane . The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . After a further two matches , against <unk> and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with Queensland . In contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . Billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second @-@ half . Following the loss of <unk> , the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game . <unk> later said : 
 It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing <unk> , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some <unk> ; at all events , when accused of it at half @-@ time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
 The response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . The team travelled to <unk> , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . The <unk> included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles <unk> , after the <unk> reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in <unk> on 5 August . 
 
 = = Return to New Zealand = = 
 
 Two days after their return , the <unk> faced <unk> , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 . The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited <unk> W. <unk> for their match against <unk> District on 8 August . Despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 . Following the side 's return to New Zealand , the <unk> Rugby Football Union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland . <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . The Northern Rugby Union ( since renamed Queensland Rugby Union ) summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 Queensland Rugby Union Annual : 
 ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . The matter was bought before the <unk> Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ... 
 It is unlikely , given the attitude of the <unk> Rugby Union to the <unk> before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed . The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced <unk> in <unk> . The <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 . The side 's star player and half @-@ back , <unk> , stayed in <unk> when the team departed for <unk> . The side faced <unk> 's Bay , who were touring , in <unk> , and <unk> defeated them 13 – 2 . The <unk> ' play was praised by The Press : " ... the <unk> of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " . The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August , who they <unk> 15 – 0 . The report published in The Press said of the <unk> ' performance : 
 The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . In the loose , in the <unk> , <unk> , passing , <unk> , or running they were very much indeed Canterbury 's superior . Such runs as were made by <unk> at full back , by Madigan , <unk> , and W. <unk> , the passing of H. <unk> , F. <unk> , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of <unk> <unk> , Maynard , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> powers of nearly every one , <unk> their opponents ... 
 The side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match . After this the <unk> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats . 
 
 = = Impact and legacy = = 
 
 The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand . It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . By the time the <unk> returned to New Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . Seventeen of the 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained New Zealand . 
 The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( <unk> , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides . The <unk> sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team , captained by <unk> , to tour Australia in 1893 . The <unk> are also the <unk> of the Māori All Blacks , a representative team organised by the <unk> , that first played in 1910 . The Native team , along with Joe <unk> , was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2008 – the seventh <unk> .

 <unk> <unk> ( September 20 , 1885 – December 20 , 1958 ) was a Canadian @-@ American <unk> @-@ soprano and voice teacher . She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik <unk> , Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky , including the title role in the latter 's <unk> . 
 The niece of Lady <unk> and Sir Wilfrid <unk> , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in Europe . She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to North American audiences on her return . She retired from performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors . <unk> was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music . The citation from the <unk> Society of San Francisco , which she received in 1949 , said : " ... her rare open @-@ mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers "

 Born in Ottawa , Ontario , <unk> received musical lessons as a child , in harmony , voice , and piano .

In 1906 , <unk> was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of <unk> to <unk> during the 30 week tour of Canada . 
 Lord <unk> awarded <unk> a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies . She returned there and continued both to study and give performances . Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in <unk> , Italy as <unk> in <unk> 's Carmen . She landed a second operatic role as <unk> in <unk> ' <unk> , which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company .

Her accompanying pianist was Paul <unk> , who had previously been the conductor for the <unk> of <unk> , which afforded <unk> a number of opportunities . On permission of the Javanese court , she studied the <unk> , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . While living in Java , <unk> travelled extensively , giving performances in China , Japan , Singapore , Malaya , Australia , and New Zealand . She remained in Java for four years , but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America , arriving in New York City in the fall of 1915 .

 Arriving in New York , <unk> struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene . She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled <unk> , which combined <unk> music with dancers . New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers , so <unk> focused on her <unk> musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing . <unk> began giving annual recitals at <unk> Hall , and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers . She developed her own reputation quickly , known as a " ... sensitive <unk> of interesting , <unk> songs " . She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel . Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky 's Three Japanese Lyrics and <unk> ' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan . The performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers . Stravinsky arranged to have <unk> to premiere all of his vocal pieces . 
 <unk> travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . <unk> there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik <unk> and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform <unk> <unk> by Arnold <unk> . Through this , <unk> performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States . She also included American music in all of her concerts . <unk> toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics . 
 Her 1923 annual performance at <unk> Hall entitled " <unk> of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice " became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George <unk> , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by <unk> <unk> and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold <unk> , Darius <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Paul <unk> . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's <unk> Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George <unk> : I 'll <unk> a <unk> to Paradise , Innocent <unk> Baby , and <unk> . <unk> played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included <unk> Schumann @-@ <unk> , Virgil Thomson , and Paul <unk> . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art . 
 <unk> continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences . On some occasions , such as her performances of <unk> in New York in 1923 and 1925 , as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful . A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a <unk> from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , <unk> , Wolf , Richard <unk> - while praising her skill with more classical choices . Other performances suffered – she was <unk> while performing works by <unk> Villa @-@ <unk> at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice . She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada . On the <unk> anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first <unk> radio broadcast in Canada . Although she toured Canada from time to time , and attended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a negative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying " Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people . "

 Illness forced <unk> to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giving a concert in Havana , Cuba . As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing . Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . She retired from performing entirely in 1937 , and opened a music studio in New York . There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists , serving on its board of governors . She died on December 20 , 1958 .

 <unk> was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . The <unk> of jazz music for a <unk> trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to <unk> her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to <unk> her for taking <unk> music into a <unk> venue . 
 A May 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the <unk> quality of her voice . Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them . " 
 A November 12 , 1923 Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs , as well as modern English , French , Austrian , German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music . The critic remarked " Her voice was much too good for jazz . " Here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was " ... <unk> and expressive . " The audience received the concert very enthusiastically . 
 Her performance in <unk> in 1923 resulted in a headline in the <unk> <unk> the next day that was headed Eva <unk> ’ s Program <unk> Whole Town <unk> : Many People Are of Two <unk> Regarding Jazz Numbers – Some <unk> <unk> That They Like Them – Others <unk> Silent or <unk> Them . The review divides the audience and critics into various camps : those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance ; those who openly disliked and condemned it ; those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate ; and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or <unk> .

 = Battle of Sullivan 's Island = 
 
 The Battle of Sullivan 's Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on June 28 , 1776 , during the American Revolutionary War . It took place near Charleston , South Carolina , during the first British attempt to capture the city from American rebels . It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston , owing to a more successful British siege in <unk> . 
 The British organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America . <unk> by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May 1776 . Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston . Arriving there in early June , troops were landed on Long Island , near Sullivan 's Island where Colonel William <unk> commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault . General Charles Lee , commanding the southern Continental theater of the war , would provide supervision . 
 The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to <unk> , and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing . The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the <unk> nature of the fort 's <unk> log construction . <unk> fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment . The British withdrew their expedition force to New York , and did not return to South Carolina until <unk> . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 , the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America . The city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord . Throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's <unk> , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city . 
 
 = = = British operations = = = 
 
 British army forces in North America were primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston in 1775 . <unk> bases of operations where they had more control , the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies . Major General Henry Clinton , then in Boston , was to travel to Cape Fear , North Carolina , where he would join with largely Scottish <unk> raised in the North Carolina <unk> , and a force of 2 @,@ 000 men from Ireland under the command of Major General Charles Cornwallis . 
 The plan was beset by difficulties from the start . The Irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker . Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor . Major General Charles Lee , sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York , <unk> arrived there the same day as Clinton . New York was at that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . Despite this , Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . Lee observed that this was " certainly a <unk> way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . " This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South . 
 Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March 12 , expecting to find the European convoy already there . He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina , Josiah Martin and William Campbell , and learned that the recruited Scottish <unk> had been defeated at Moore 's Creek Bridge two weeks earlier . Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia , James Wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship . 
 Parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . <unk> by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18 , and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3 . After several weeks there , in which the British troops raided <unk> properties , Clinton , Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations . Parker had sent out some ships on <unk> expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there . 
 
 = = = American defenses = = = 
 
 John <unk> , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 @-@ year @-@ old Colonel William <unk> , a former <unk> and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about 2 @,@ 000 . These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia ( 1 @,@ 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 @,@ 700 from Charleston and the surrounding <unk> . 
 <unk> saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy <unk> of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from <unk> enemy warships . A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged <unk> lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . <unk> and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor . The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter <unk> of the <unk> naval detachment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot " . The gun platforms were made of <unk> two inches thick and <unk> with wooden spikes . 
 Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton 's fleet as it sailed south . Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina . He headed for Charleston , saying " [ I ] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy . " He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses . He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments ) were not on the Continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions , and <unk> had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces . 
 Square @-@ shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from <unk> logs 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide . The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . A hastily erected palisade of thick <unk> helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . An assortment of 31 cannon , ranging from <unk> and 12 @-@ pounders to a few British 18 @-@ pounders and French 26 @-@ pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . General Lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a " slaughter pen " . President <unk> refused , and specifically ordered Colonel <unk> to " obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan " . <unk> 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace <unk> ; the battle began the next day before he could do so . Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to <unk> 's Point .

 The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31 , and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day . <unk> noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of <unk> ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8 , most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five <unk> Hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . With the fort on Sullivan 's Island only half complete , Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . <unk> believing he would not even need Clinton 's land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land <unk> and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose ) under the guns " and that they could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper " . 
 The British fleet was composed of nine man @-@ of @-@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun Bristol , as well as the 50 @-@ gun Experiment and frigates <unk> , Active , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon . The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th Regiments of Foot , and part of the 46th . On June 7 , Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . However , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day . That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would <unk> across the channel ( now known as <unk> Inlet ) between Long and Sullivan 's , which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan . 
 General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston . He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an <unk> of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of <unk> and <unk> to support the effort may also have played a role . The Americans also constructed an <unk> at the northern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to <unk> a guard post at <unk> 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan . 
 General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 . An attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position . As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire at long range . Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone . " The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days .

 On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men . At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . Less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the fort while Parker took Active , Bristol , Experiment and <unk> to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from Sullivan 's Island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , " We had a <unk> in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried " . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing to shortage of gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . They also fired in small <unk> , four cannon at a time . One British observer wrote , " Their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . " 
 General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan 's Island . <unk> by two <unk> of war , the flotilla of <unk> carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson 's defenses . Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , Clinton abandoned the attempt . 
 Around noon the frigates <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some <unk> , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort . However , all three ships grounded on an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> became entangled in the process . The British managed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged <unk> . Consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel <unk> : " Had these three ships effected their purpose , they would have <unk> us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . " 
 At the fort , <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships , Bristol and Experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns . Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> . One round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh . The shot also tore off part of his <unk> , leaving his <unk> exposed . By mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . However , Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling Colonel <unk> , " I see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the town again . " Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> . This strategy failed due to the <unk> nature of the <unk> wood used in its constructions ; the structure would <unk> , and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> . The exchange continued until around 9 : 00 pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . 
 At one point during the battle , the flag <unk> had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the <unk> and raised the flag again , holding it up and <unk> the troops until a flag stand could be provided . He was credited by <unk> with reviving the troops ' spirits , and later given <unk> for bravery . A painting of this event ( pictured above ) depicts Jasper 's actions . 
 <unk> casualties , Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol , which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded . Active and <unk> reported 15 casualties each . The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded . The following morning , the British , unable to drag the grounded <unk> off the <unk> , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . <unk> in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the British ships , took what stores and <unk> they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded .

 The British did not attempt to take the fort again . Within days of the battle , <unk> learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia . The British troops were <unk> on their transports , and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City . To add insult to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by <unk> forces . 
 The British did not return to Charleston until <unk> , when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778 , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . 
 Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition 's failures . Although Clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery .

 Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort <unk> shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William <unk> for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston . <unk> modified in the years after the battle , it was <unk> by Fort <unk> as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War . In 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , companies from Savannah , Augusta , <unk> , Columbia , New York and Boston were invited to Charleston . The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort <unk> National Monument . 
 A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan 's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where General Clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross . The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . 
 One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel <unk> . Commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . It came to be known as the <unk> flag or Liberty Flag . When Charleston ( lost to the British in the <unk> siege ) was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General <unk> Greene .

 Hu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; c . <unk> – 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , <unk> and publisher . He worked in calligraphy , traditional Chinese painting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work . 
 Hu lived in <unk> during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty . A Ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the <unk> Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . He did , however , design the <unk> Emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 . He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten <unk> Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and <unk> techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise . Hu 's work at the Ten <unk> Studio pioneered new techniques in colour <unk> , leading to delicate <unk> of colour which were not previously <unk> in this art form . 
 Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> , an artist 's <unk> which remained in print for around 200 years . His studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers .

 Hu was born in <unk> County , Anhui Province in <unk> or early <unk> . Both his father and elder brother <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) were <unk> , and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around Lu 'an and <unk> . It is commonly stated that <unk> himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources <unk> to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century . 
 By 1619 , Hu had moved to <unk> where he lived with his wife Wu . Their home on <unk> ( <unk> , now also known as <unk> <unk> ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @-@ house for like @-@ minded artists . Hu named it the Ten <unk> Studio ( <unk> , <unk> ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) and his sons <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , courtesy name <unk> ) . 
 During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in <unk> with Zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> Emperor . Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of <unk> for the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals ) . 
 According to <unk> <unk> 's Lost History of the South ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , prior to the Qing invasion of <unk> Hu studied at the National University there , and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of <unk> to record official <unk> ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban <unk> , <unk> ) and the Record of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Ji , <unk> ) as part of this work . As a result , he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained <unk> to the <unk> Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had fallen to the <unk> rebellion . Since contemporaneous biographies ( <unk> 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death . 
 Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 , after the end of the Ming dynasty . <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> recorded visiting him during his later years , in 1667 and <unk> respectively . He died in poverty at the age of 90 , sometime around late <unk> or early 1674 .

 Hu <unk> was a noted seal @-@ <unk> , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the <unk> school of carving founded by his contemporary He <unk> . Hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear <unk> structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . <unk> seals attempt to <unk> an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other <unk> artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals . 
 Hu 's work was known outside his local area . Zhou <unk> , a poet who lived in <unk> around the same time as Hu and was a noted art <unk> , stated in his Biography of Seal @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) that Hu " creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through <unk> . 
 In 1644 , Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the <unk> Emperor , which he carved after a period of <unk> and prayer . He presented his creation with an essay , the Great <unk> of the Seal ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , in which he <unk> the loss of the <unk> Emperor 's seal and <unk> Heaven 's favour in restoring it . Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally @-@ footed couplets ( <unk> , <unk> ) used in the Imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court .

His publishing house , the Ten <unk> Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and <unk> ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics . Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten <unk> Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts . Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten <unk> Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . Hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author of these books . 
 During the <unk> the Ten <unk> Studio also produced political works <unk> the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of <unk> ( Huang Ming <unk> Ji , <unk> ) , a biography of loyal Ming officials , and the <unk> of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming <unk> , <unk> ) , a list of Imperial <unk> . After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall <unk> in the Past ( <unk> , <unk> ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the Ten <unk> imprint continued to be used . Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part <unk> on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work . 
 The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu <unk> experimented with various forms of <unk> printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as " <unk> block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . It was a lengthy , <unk> process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not previously possible . 
 In some images , Hu employed a blind <unk> technique ( known as " <unk> designs " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " <unk> blocks " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . This was a relatively new process , having been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher . Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published in <unk> . Both Hu and Wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a <unk> income for the Ten <unk> Studio .

 Hu 's most notable work is the Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 . It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy . Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and analytical approach to Chinese painting . In this book , Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . The manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread . This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in August , 2015 . Said Charles <unk> , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , " The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was <unk> , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars . " 
 This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known Manual of the <unk> <unk> Garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also in Japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <unk> @-@ e of the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> . The popularity of the Ten <unk> Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty . 
 Hu also produced the work Ten <unk> Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the <unk> stamped <unk> technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . The book was bound in the " wrapped back " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , in which the <unk> pages are folded , stacked , and <unk> along the open edges . Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by <unk> <unk> and Lu <unk> , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

 Other works produced by Hu 's studio included a reprint of Zhou <unk> 's manual of seal @-@ script calligraphy , The Six <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) and the related <unk> Investigations into <unk> ( <unk> Bi Ji , <unk> ) , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters . With his brother <unk> , Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics , entitled The <unk> Text of the Four Books , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . A similar approach was taken with the <unk> of the Thousand Character Classic in Six <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1663 ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , Li <unk> . It was published after Li 's death , partly in homage to him . 
 The three Hu brothers worked together to <unk> a student <unk> on poetry by their contemporary <unk> <unk> , which was called simply the <unk> of Poetry ( Shi Tan , <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . Other works on poetry from the studio included <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of Selected Tang Poems ( <unk> Tang Shi <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included <unk> by Hu <unk> himself . 
 Among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese <unk> entitled <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu <unk> .

 = Raid on Manila ( 1798 ) = 
 
 The Raid on Manila of January 1798 was a Royal Navy false flag military operation during the French Revolutionary Wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of Manila , capital of the Spanish Philippines , capture a Manila galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squadron maintained in the port . Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796 . Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet , an annual convoy of East <unk> merchant ships from <unk> in Qing Dynasty China to Britain , which was of vital economic importance to Britain . So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of <unk> <unk> in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore . 
 To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at <unk> in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter <unk> , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS <unk> and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke . After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself . He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable prize . <unk> in <unk> and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798 . 
 <unk> in Manila Bay , Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive <unk> of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been <unk> at <unk> and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the <unk> River . <unk> the gunboats in a bloodless attack , Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting <unk> before returning to <unk> .

 In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San <unk> . The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east . Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean . 
 Some of the most important trade routes began at <unk> and <unk> in Qing Dynasty China . Early in each year a large convoy known as the " China Fleet " , composed of large East <unk> merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company , sailed <unk> to Europe from <unk> laden with tea and other commercial cargo . This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . In January 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , comprising six frigates commanded by <unk> @-@ <unk> Pierre César Charles de <unk> . In the ensuing <unk> Strait Incident the commander deceived <unk> into believing that the <unk> convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to Île de France . There was considerable concern in India that <unk> might try again in 1798 , or that the Spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at <unk> , might make an attempt of their own . 
 <unk> 's initial impulse on learning in November 1796 of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines , centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in <unk> . Co @-@ operating with the Governor @-@ General of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur <unk> among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in India in August 1797 announcing the Treaty of <unk> <unk> which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end . Britain now faced France and Spain alone , while <unk> from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an old opponent of Britain in Southern India , were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and <unk> diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China . 
 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to <unk> to load trade goods and join the China Fleet . To escort this force , <unk> provided the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS <unk> , captured from the French at the Battle of <unk> in 1794 , and the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion , which sailed with the convoy in July , taking passage through the Straits of <unk> , joined there by the ships of the line HMS <unk> and HMS <unk> and the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to <unk> . The convoy arrived without incident on 13 December 1797 , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses .

 With his convoy safely at anchor in <unk> and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there . As an added motivation , rumours in <unk> suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive . This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila . <unk> its dollars in the Philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain . This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only <unk> by the substantial subsidy from New Spain . Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila <unk> since Thomas <unk> in <unk> . 
 Leaving the heavier warships at <unk> , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with <unk> and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard , an experienced linguist . Passing Luzon , Cooke 's ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying French <unk> . <unk> the Spanish vessel , Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at <unk> and were unfit to sail . Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 @,@ 900 silver dollars . The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila . Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels , modelling <unk> on the powerful 40 @-@ gun Forte and Fox on the smaller <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> on <unk> = = = 
 
 Late in the afternoon of 13 January 1798 , <unk> and Fox arrived in Manila Bay , slipping <unk> past the fortress of <unk> and then sailing across the bay on the morning of 14 January , anchoring between Manila and <unk> . From his <unk> point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in <unk> , the ships of the line San Pedro , Europa and <unk> and the frigates Maria de la <unk> and <unk> in dock and unfit for action . To Cooke 's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon , <unk> being <unk> at the <unk> docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour . The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke 's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward <unk> was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack . 
 Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the <unk> , whose crew came aboard . Malcolm , like Cooke , spoke French <unk> and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new <unk> were Forte and <unk> seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest . Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore <unk> , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra . The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the <unk> , which had been augmented by fake French uniforms . <unk> the visitor below decks , Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of <unk> , including " the downfall of England " . 
 For an hour the officers drank , Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to <unk> the French <unk> . This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at <unk> , Rear @-@ Admiral Don <unk> María de <unk> , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat . Each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at <unk> and taken below decks as prisoners of war . In Malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the British frigates sailed , and offered more wine . The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and <unk> their clothing . <unk> into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby <unk> River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . Taking the crews by surprise , the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox . These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well @-@ armed , one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four <unk> guns . 
 The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . Malcolm received him with a <unk> of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and <unk> to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 . Once the meal was finished , Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 Cooke led his small squadron past <unk> on 15 January and turned south . Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew . The frigates subsequently scouted <unk> before reaching <unk> on 22 January . There Cooke raised Spanish colours in an attempt to <unk> the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but <unk> grounded on a <unk> at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a <unk> sent by the governor of <unk> , <unk> <unk> . The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert . With the defenders <unk> , Cooke abandoned his <unk> and after <unk> <unk> the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour . This had little effect , though later the Spanish recovered at least 450 <unk> from different <unk> , and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the <unk> side of the fort . The boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a <unk> , killing two and wounding four . Another boat grounded on a <unk> and became stuck ; so with his force in <unk> , as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the beach , Malcolm called off the operation . After exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with two dead and one wounded on <unk> and eight wounded on Fox , in addition to those lost in the boats . The defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded . 
 With his frigates now requiring repairs , Cooke withdraw half a league from <unk> and spent three days <unk> the masts and rigging of the ships . Then he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to <unk> . Four days later , on 27 January the squadron halted at a village named " <unk> " in the north of the Sultanate of <unk> to collect fresh water . On the beach a boat party from <unk> was set upon by <unk> tribesmen . Two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive . Cooke complained to Sultan <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before <unk> and Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 Cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : Admiral <unk> later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty . More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C. <unk> Parkinson suggests that had Cooke 's squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at <unk> . He also notes however that in this scenario <unk> would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and <unk> than Cooke . Historian Richard <unk> was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short @-@ coming . 
 The 1798 China Fleet sailed without further incident . During the ensuing year Resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in July in the <unk> Strait , and the majority of <unk> 's forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea . This diversion of British resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and <unk> was able to send the frigate <unk> and <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron . At the beginning of February <unk> , this combined force sailed to <unk> , taking the British defences by surprise . The British commander Captain William <unk> <unk> , advancing on the Franco @-@ Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the <unk> Archipelago . The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of <unk> <unk> in 1804 , at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion . The frigates Cooke had mimicked , Forte and <unk> were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early <unk> . <unk> was captured by HMS <unk> at the Action of 9 February <unk> near Southern Africa , and Forte was intercepted by HMS <unk> under Cooke on 28 February near <unk> in Bengal . In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded , dying on 25 May . 
 
 
 = B of the Bang = 
 
 B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas <unk> next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester , England , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games ; it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of <unk> in 2008 . It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the " <unk> " of the starting pistol , but at " the B of the Bang " . 
 The sculpture was commissioned in 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005 . Six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground . Legal action started a year later , resulting in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement totalling £ 1 @.@ 7 million . 
 In February 2009 , Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage . Despite the promise of storage and potential <unk> , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal . The core was sold for scrap in July 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain in storage . 
 
 = = Design and statistics = = 
 
 B of the Bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m ( 72 ft ) above the ground . The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab . The foundations are 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep . 
 The sculpture was made from the same <unk> steel ( also known as <unk> @-@ Ten ) as the Angel of the North sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its <unk> to water . As part of the design , the spikes <unk> slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 . The location of the time capsule after <unk> is currently unknown . 
 B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at <unk> , in <unk> , at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ; . It took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the ' <unk> ' of the starting pistol , but at ' The B of the Bang ' . The artwork had been nicknamed <unk> by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s . 
 Prior to the construction of <unk> at the University of Nottingham , B of the Bang was Britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North , which stands at 66 feet ( 20 m ) . It was designed to look like an exploding <unk> and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games . The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by Thomas <unk> .

 The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas <unk> Studio , <unk> Lucas , Flint and <unk> and <unk> Structures . It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004 . This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached . Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang . 
 The official unveiling by <unk> Christie took place on 12 January 2005 . 
 In total the sculpture cost £ 1 @.@ 42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £ 700 @,@ 000 , the North West Development Agency , contributing £ 500 @,@ 000 , and Manchester City Council providing £ 120 @,@ 000 .

 The tip of one of the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005 , only six days before the official unveiling . After inspection , the event went ahead as planned . 
 Four months later , in May 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by <unk> after it was discovered hanging loose . At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . As a result , some of the joints were re @-@ <unk> , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . This consisted of <unk> tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights . 
 Despite these modifications , B of the Bang remained <unk> off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' Get It <unk> ' . In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for <unk> analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . 
 It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . In November 2008 this culminated in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council , the project 's designers Thomas <unk> Studio Ltd , and the engineering and construction <unk> <unk> Lucas Ltd , Flint and <unk> Partnership and <unk> Structures Ltd . The agreement was to pay the council £ <unk> in damages for breach of contract and negligence .

 Acting on a report in January 2009 , the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe <unk> . The report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long @-@ term solution . One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with <unk> made from carbon fibre , although the report <unk> the necessity for extensive testing . 
 In January 2009 , Antony <unk> , creator of the Angel of the North — to which B of the Bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , " It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground @-@ breaking work was commissioned . To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's <unk> . " 
 Despite <unk> 's plea , removal of B of the Bang began in April 2009 . More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm <unk> Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with <unk> cutting equipment . 
 Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early July 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £ 17 @,@ 000 . 
 
 
 = Battle of the <unk> River = 
 
 The Battle of the <unk> River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian , New Zealand and Japanese forces . Part of the wider <unk> Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of <unk> Island . Coming after the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the <unk> Road . 
 The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the <unk> River . Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies . As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again . Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .

 Japanese forces had landed on <unk> in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians <unk> the island . They had subsequently developed several <unk> on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area . These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that <unk> was vital for <unk> the Japanese base around Rabaul . 
 US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape <unk> , on the western coast of the island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> , establishing a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on <unk> became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around <unk> . 
 In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley <unk> — took over responsibility for Allied operations on <unk> from the American XIV Corps . Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the US base at <unk> . Due to inaccurate intelligence , <unk> mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted . However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . 
 The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> .

 Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> . In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines . Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> River . The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an " intermediate objective " . Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division . The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest . 
 Under the command of Brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units . The <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for <unk> 's Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the <unk> Road . The brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade 's 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the <unk> River , in the <unk> area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them . Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank . 
 The Japanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the 6th Division , under the command of Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> . <unk> had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the <unk> and the <unk> for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian 's expected line of advance . The division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around <unk> 's Knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five <unk> to their rear along and <unk> the <unk> Road , designated ' A ' through to ' E ' . The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held <unk> further back , designated ' F ' and ' G ' . The 23rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on <unk> 's Knoll .

 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial <unk> had the 24th Infantry Battalion on the <unk> Road around <unk> Creek , with the <unk> / 59th around <unk> , north @-@ east of <unk> 's Knoll , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east <unk> a secondary , parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road . Two days later , <unk> received the order to commence the advance towards the <unk> from <unk> , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter @-@ attack . In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @-@ battalion front , instead of one . The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the <unk> Road with the <unk> / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , commencing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion . 
 Moving forward under a <unk> barrage as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around <unk> 's Creek on 17 April . <unk> by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards <unk> and <unk> . The left forward company — ' D ' Company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' C ' Company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down . ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the <unk> track . In support of ' A ' Company , <unk> came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the <unk> to reveal several Japanese <unk> , which were destroyed by the Australian armour . As night fell , ' C ' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning . Engineers were brought forward , as was a <unk> , and the gap was <unk> . <unk> heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek . By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded . After this , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the southeast . In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back . During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing . Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April . 
 <unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
 Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May . On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> . 
 After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . Against this , the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed . 
 
 = = = Crossing the <unk> = = = 
 
 Following the advance to the <unk> , there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> . This allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
 The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road . Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge . After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " . 
 Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May . 
 In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
 On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese . Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese . The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
 By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed . Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island . Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> . These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . 
 As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , " to a sea of mud " and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away . This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
 Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> Peninsula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations . 
 Following the end of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the <unk> River . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour " <unk> River " . A second battle honour — " <unk> 's Ridge – <unk> Ford " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 24th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of " Commando Road " for this period . 
 
 
 = Sonic the Hedgehog ( 1991 video game ) = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month . The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button . 
 The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves " Sonic Team " to match their character . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> . 
 The game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay . The game was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super <unk> console . It has been ported a number of times , and inspired several <unk> , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media . 
 
 = = Plot = = 
 
 In an attempt to steal the six Chaos <unk> and <unk> their power , the game 's antagonist , Dr. Ivo <unk> , has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . The player controls Sonic , who aims to halt <unk> 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <unk> himself . 
 If the player collects all the Chaos <unk> and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown . If all the <unk> are not collected , <unk> taunts the player while <unk> the Chaos <unk> instead . 
 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around Sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops . The levels contain <unk> in the form of robots ( " <unk> " in the Western game manuals ) inside of which Dr. <unk> has trapped animals . Although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) . Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . 
 <unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer of protection against <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive . However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again . If Sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . Although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection . 
 The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts Dr. <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight . After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with <unk> . 
 The player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when Sonic <unk> with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @-@ screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit . <unk> acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the <unk> will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the <unk> . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) . 
 When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a " Secret Zone " in the original Genesis manual ) . In each of six Special <unk> , Sonic <unk> off the <unk> and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a " goal block " ( which ends the level ) .

 = = = Background and character design = = = 
 
 In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . This was a position already held by the character Alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse . Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry . Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . 
 <unk> developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . Development emphasized speed , so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels . One idea , a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> character , first proposed by <unk> <unk> , prevailed , although the <unk> would later become the basis for Mighty the <unk> ( who first appeared in 1993 's <unk> the Hedgehog ) . <unk> has admitted since that he created Sonic 's basic design by combining Felix the Cat 's head with Mickey Mouse 's body . 
 Sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo . His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom <unk> saw as the most " famous character in the world " . Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) . The new character was originally named " Mr. <unk> " , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to " Sonic " and their studios to Sonic Team . <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named " Dr. <unk> " in Japan and " Dr. <unk> " in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's American and Japanese divisions . 
 
 = = = Programming and <unk> = = = 
 
 With a satisfying protagonist completed , Sega turned to esteemed programmer <unk> <unk> , who had impressed them through his work on <unk> Star and the Genesis port of <unk> ' n <unk> . The gameplay originated with a tech demo by <unk> , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . <unk> 's prototype was a platform game with a fast @-@ moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was <unk> out with <unk> 's character designs and levels by designer <unk> <unk> . <unk> originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was <unk> in the project for nearly a year . His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . The game 's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist <unk> Suzuki , and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California . 
 In designing the game mechanics , <unk> was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . <unk> the simplicity of Miyamoto 's mechanics in complex environments , <unk> decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . He also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis ' technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months . The developers ' efforts were rewarded ; according to <unk> <unk> , the game had the fastest @-@ ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console . The team intended to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split @-@ screen , but <unk> 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . However , such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control Sonic 's best friend Miles " <unk> " <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months . 
 <unk> 's relationship with Sega of Japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game . He left the company shortly after the game 's release , although Sega of America hired him later . Before leaving , however , he defied Sega of Japan 's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game 's code .

 The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato <unk> , bassist and lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True . The game uses <unk> Yamaha <unk> and <unk> programmable sound generators to produce a variety of <unk> sound effects and music . It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic <unk> to the music of a " Sonic Band " of <unk> <unk> on guitar , Max Monkey on bass , <unk> <unk> on drums , and <unk> the Crocodile on keyboard . The playable <unk> became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in <unk> ' <unk> , Sonic Heroes , and Sonic Free <unk> . The development schedule scrapped the feature , and <unk> <unk> replaced the test with the " Se @-@ <unk> ! " chant used in TV commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth of the memory of the four @-@ <unk> cartridge ) . 
 On October 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan .

According to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design " similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages " – something " original " and " stylish " . The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June 23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 . Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing <unk> Beast .

The game rivaled the Mario series , particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) . Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and Super Mario World as having more " depth of play " . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics . Rand called its color scheme " lively , but never <unk> " , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis . Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds " eye @-@ popping " and " gorgeous " , which was echoed by Mean Machines . According to the <unk> ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , " The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year " and <unk> called the animation " some of the <unk> and fastest ... ever seen " . The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them " great " , and <unk> " amazing " . Rand noted " <unk> of catchy tunes and <unk> " , calling some of the sound effects " absolutely brilliant " .

GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its " lightning @-@ fast action " and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( <unk> ) , " If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at <unk> speed . " The game 's difficulty was disputed , described as " impossible " by Rand and " average " by <unk> . Rand said about the gameplay in general that it " plays like a dream " ; according to <unk> it would <unk> players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping . Although <unk> , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) , Paul found losing all of one 's rings frustrating . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time . Frank <unk> of GameSpot described the game as " one of the best <unk> of all time " , noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port " after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up " . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : " You 'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic 's graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game 's known for . But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 , and still does so today . " Mega ranked the game its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time .

 Co @-@ creators J. J. Abrams , Alex <unk> and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode . Paul A. Edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . In developing Fringe , the co @-@ creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams ' television series <unk> . They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and <unk> : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration . <unk> explained , " While we make sure that our episodes are self @-@ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the character stories can be serialized . They don 't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show . " " The Same Old Story " was Fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . 
 The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series ' different departments . For the scene in which they remove the victim 's <unk> , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley 's head . Using plaster to make a prosthetic , they " drilled out the <unk> and <unk> [ ed ] it open and [ went ] through a series of molds . " Stanley stated that " it 's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it 's very gruesome because the <unk> 's popping out . " The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a " <unk> gun " ; according to prop master Peter <unk> , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people 's clothing for concealed weapons . VFX Supervisor Christopher <unk> explained that for the eye 's last vision , they used " a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , " which they then used to " take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab . " 
 " The Same Old Story " featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher <unk> and Mark <unk> as his father , Dr. Claus <unk> . Other guest actors included Betty <unk> as <unk> " Amber " Daisy <unk> , Bernie <unk> as old Christopher <unk> , Carmen <unk> as Amy , <unk> Jones as a doctor , and Karin <unk> as John Scott 's sister .

 " The Same Old Story " received mixed reviews from television critics . TV Squad writer Jane <unk> thought the episode seemed " all over the place " , and wasn 't sure what to think . She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl 's eye in order to identity her killer , and the <unk> at the very end , when Walter states " If you 've read my file , then you know the truth about Peter 's medical history " . Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot ; though it was " laden with lots of <unk> <unk> and clichéd dialogue , " Fickett understood that it was needed to <unk> new viewers to the show . Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a " great show " , and he also praised the production level as " top notch " , and Torv 's performance as " very good " as she " brings a unique presence to the show " . The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C + , while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. 
 Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine disliked the " <unk> ex <unk> " aspects that " <unk> solved the puzzles of the first two episodes " , and also criticized perceived " plot <unk> " like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim . Despite these flaws , Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would " rather have a show <unk> on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and I 'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve " . Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked " The Same Old Story " better than the pilot because she thought that it " had really cool special effects , awesome Walter @-@ <unk> , and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter " , and " we also got to <unk> more into the connections between Walter , Nina Sharp , Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was <unk> " . 
 A UGO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but " after sitting down to watch Fringe 's second episode , " The Same Old Story " , my concerns have vanished . Fringe 's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without <unk> any of Fringe 's eleven @-@ herbs and spices .

It is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head . " However , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than <unk> . Guitarist Willie <unk> said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . I think I would 've noticed something like that considering the <unk> thing . " 
 According to Blythe 's attorney Martin <unk> , the police launched an investigation following the death of <unk> , about a month after the concert and following a coma .

He further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely . 
 Blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court . Among other things , one of the witnesses originally alleged that <unk> and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage ; however , at the court hearing , he testified that there was no prior contact between them . Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior . 
 
 = = = Day 3 of the trial = = = 
 
 Milan <unk> , the fan whom Blythe admitted to <unk> off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial . <unk> said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage . <unk> testified that Blythe knocked him down , <unk> on him and held him down for a moment , but Blythe definitely did not <unk> him . He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( <unk> ) was drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate . He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage . 
 Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception . She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage . Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of <unk> 's fall at the end of the concert . 
 The judge also read a sworn statement from <unk> 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from the stage . <unk> Tomáš <unk> testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert . 
 Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day . The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . The judge went again through the Blythe 's testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan <unk> whom Blythe threw off the stage . Blythe responded by saying : " To the best of my knowledge , it was Milan <unk> who was coming up [ on stage ] every time . " 
 Also that day , expert medical witness <unk> <unk> took the stand . According to The Prague Post , <unk> testified that <unk> 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the <unk> . <unk> added that the " mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient . " <unk> was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place . Since this hospital did not have a specialized <unk> department , <unk> was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . There , <unk> underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone . 
 Finally , defense asked for <unk> as a key witness fell ill . The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearings would be <unk> until March 4 , 2013 , in order to hear the defense 's witness . Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed . 
 
 = = = Day 4 of the trial = = = 
 
 On February 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was <unk> . <unk> <unk> contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous witnesses . He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . He also said that each time somebody got on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . <unk> testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind . He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . <unk> had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in <unk> , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the <unk> . 
 
 = = = Day 5 of the trial = = = 
 
 The trial resumed on March 4 , 2013 with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the court ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the defense ) . Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence . The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress . The court further heard testimonies from two <unk> . One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall . He testified that when by the exit , he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air . He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage . The ambulance arrived 5 – 10 minutes later . 
 Another <unk> was a fan , <unk> <unk> , who testified that she saw Blythe <unk> <unk> , saying " [ h ] e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , Blythe <unk> him . " According to her , the <unk> was strong enough for <unk> to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment . She testified that <unk> fell backwards . Another <unk> of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert . 
 
 = = = Day 6 of the trial = = = 
 
 A defense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of <unk> testified on March 5 that <unk> could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head . He further said that if <unk> fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the <unk> testimonies , according to which <unk> fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points . 
 In his closing speech , the State Attorney asked the court to <unk> Blythe for 5 years , claiming that " even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . " 
 A <unk> family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He continued that he would not be <unk> the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . He further added that Daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a <unk> patient unable to work . 
 In his closing word , Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so . He further commented that in case of <unk> , measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again . 
 
 = = = First instance verdict = = = 
 
 On March 5 , 2013 , the court delivered a verdict , according to which Blythe was not <unk> liable for <unk> 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . Consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe 's bail . 
 The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown <unk> off the stage . However , Blythe , due to his <unk> , could have mistaken <unk> for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the <unk> . According to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the <unk> and security members . Judge <unk> further <unk> Blythe for not having met with the <unk> family . 
 The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict . 
 
 = = = Appeals verdict = = = 
 
 The State Attorney 's appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the Prague High Court , chaired by judge <unk> <unk> . The hearing took place in Blythe 's absence . Blythe 's <unk> was upheld by the panel on June 5 , 2013 . 
 The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney ( <unk> ) to the Supreme Court . As the appeal hasn 't been lodged by <unk> within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final . 
 In 2015 Blythe demanded ca <unk> 15 millions for damages but the Municipal Court for Prague 2 dismissed the suit . 
 
 = = Reaction = = 
 
 In reaction to the arrest and detention , a fan created a petition at the official White House petition site . By the time Blythe was released on bail , it gathered over 27 @,@ 500 signatures . 
 On July 7 , 2012 , there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God 's hometown of Richmond , Virginia , by a friend of Blythe 's . At the event , <unk> ( who are also from Richmond ) frontman Dave <unk> said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested . I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up .... This stuff could have all been worked out <unk> or legally before he got there . ” In addition to <unk> , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as Tom Araya and David <unk> , have also come out in support of Blythe . 
 In a post to his blog , Blythe explained that he met the <unk> family in private after the trial , and promised them to be " a spokesperson for safer shows " . He emphasized that the family never attacked him and " just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son " . 
 
 
 = U.S. Route 2 in Michigan = 
 
 US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St. Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin . As one of the major transportation <unk> in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states . Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated Pure Michigan <unk> . There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s . The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process . 
 The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century . The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated in 1919 . Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

 According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway . The roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest " , and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP . The 305 @.@ 151 miles ( 491 @.@ <unk> km ) of roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin . 
 
 = = = Western segment = = = 
 
 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and <unk> , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway crosses the river into <unk> County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . Running along <unk> Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard . The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <unk> . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a <unk> in town . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <unk> Isle River . US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the <unk> Isle in the community of <unk> . This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake <unk> . 
 The highway continues parallel to the state line from the <unk> area through the national forest toward <unk> . That unincorporated community is the home of the <unk> High School <unk> , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel . The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the <unk> River , to Lake Michigan via the <unk> and <unk> rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers . Also located in the area are the <unk> Wilderness , and the Lac <unk> Desert Indian <unk> , which includes the Lac <unk> Desert Casino and Resort . The highway travels southeasterly from <unk> around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County . US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( <unk> 16 ) near Golden Lake in <unk> Township in the middle of the national forest . The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M ‑ 73 . In town , US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city . 
 US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County . On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue . The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county <unk> at the top of the hill . US 2 / US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the <unk> River . The roadway passes Railroad , Kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the <unk> River , crossing into Florence County , Wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) . 
 
 = = = Eastern segment = = = 
 
 US 2 / US 141 re @-@ enters Michigan where it crosses the <unk> River and subsequently meets M ‑ 95 in <unk> Township north of Iron Mountain and <unk> . The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on <unk> Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine , parallel to a branch line of the <unk> and Lake Superior Railroad ( <unk> Railroad ) . The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the <unk> Mine . In downtown Iron Mountain at <unk> Street , M ‑ 95 turns west off <unk> Avenue to run across town to <unk> . US 2 / US 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the <unk> Mall . The highway re @-@ enters <unk> Township where US 141 separates to the south to re @-@ enter Wisconsin . US 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( <unk> Railway ) . Both road and rail travel through the community of <unk> , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP . The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 . Then US 2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan , passing north of <unk> Lake through the <unk> Country State Forest , before crossing the Sturgeon River in <unk> and passing into <unk> County . 
 In <unk> County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of <unk> before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and <unk> on the south side of the <unk> Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> Indian Community . Harris is on the <unk> County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of <unk> River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <unk> . 
 US 2 / US 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> Street , which forms the east – west axis of the <unk> street grid . Near downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue . The <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State <unk> , site of one of the two state <unk> for the state of Michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> . US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de <unk> Community College . The four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de <unk> . The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 . 
 The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access . Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the <unk> Railroad south of the <unk> for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest . The expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de <unk> before ending at Rapid River . In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the <unk> National Forest . Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de <unk> . After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County . 
 As the highway approaches Thompson , US 2 leaves the western unit of the <unk> National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest . The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to <unk> , crossing the <unk> River . The trunkline turns inland approaching <unk> and then turns north @-@ northeast to Blaney Park . The community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @-@ resort at the southern terminus of M ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s . From Blaney Park , US 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City . Where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the <unk> Railway one last time and runs to the south of <unk> to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through <unk> . After passing the community of <unk> , US 2 crosses the Cut River Bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the Cut River . The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the <unk> National Forest near <unk> , running between Lake Michigan and <unk> Lake in the process . The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline , passing <unk> Spot near <unk> Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace . The US 2 designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75 . The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I ‑ 75 ( BL I ‑ 75 ) .

 = = = Indian trail through auto trails = = = 
 
 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 . The <unk> – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <unk> and St. Ignace . The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with <unk> <unk> . Marie . 
 In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names . When the original roadways between <unk> and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> Trail . Later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely in 1927 . The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 . Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the <unk> . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 2 from <unk> to the M ‑ 94 junction in <unk> , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan . <unk> of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and <unk> . The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. 
 One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> . Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail . The <unk> varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name . 
 
 = = = State trunkline = = = 
 
 The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert <unk> near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of <unk> . When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin . The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to <unk> became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) . M ‑ 12 from <unk> south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part of a larger extension . 
 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown <unk> . A larger <unk> was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown <unk> was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the <unk> and designations of the highways around <unk> , Thompson and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between <unk> and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 . 
 The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between <unk> and <unk> , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the <unk> Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the <unk> into St. Ignace . US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 . Further changes in the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and Crystal Falls . 
 Additional <unk> were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern <unk> routing between Gould City and <unk> in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> . The former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into <unk> was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was <unk> around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II . 
 The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <unk> from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 . 
 
 = = = Interstate era = = = 
 
 With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and <unk> St. Marie . In planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the <unk> . It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas <unk> in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans for the freeway system . The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) . 
 The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between <unk> <unk> and M ‑ 123 north of St. Ignace . The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge . In 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and <unk> <unk> sections . At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation <unk> US 27 on the bridge , and US 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the freeways in the St. Ignace area . The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I ‑ 75 . More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in <unk> <unk> . Marie as well as between <unk> and <unk> . The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to <unk> , and the section between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . At this time , all of US 2 's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H @-@ 63 ) . 
 The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1971 . The state built a new bridge over the <unk> River in 1983 , bypassing downtown . MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways . The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> Bridge , through downtown . In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway . The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .

 On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the <unk> Highway to honor Frank P. <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 . In 1929 , the residents of <unk> created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane . The project consisted of <unk> and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of town . The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . Later in 1949 , the <unk> Women 's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . Also called Memory Lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) of US 2 east of <unk> . 
 Most of US 2 , along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula , was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949 . To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls . Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed . 
 The <unk> Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern <unk> city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County . The American Veterans ( <unk> ) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959 . 
 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near <unk> to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in <unk> to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( <unk> ) . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . " On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP <unk> Coast Recreational Heritage Trail . 
 
 = = Historic bridges = = 
 
 There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( <unk> ) . A third bridge added to the <unk> in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however . The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on the <unk> on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance . 
 In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the <unk> River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the <unk> River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 . 
 In 2003 , MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in <unk> Township , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list . It was built in 1929 . 
 Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through <unk> and crossed the <unk> River on what is nicknamed the " <unk> Bridge " . Built as a part of a <unk> <unk> on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . This produces a <unk> effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The <unk> <unk> and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the <unk> River to supply their mill . This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . Instead of expensive <unk> , a concrete tank was built <unk> in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man @-@ made banks higher than the natural banks . The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . " The <unk> Tourism Council stated : " At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was <unk> forced under it , " and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight @-@ span structure is <unk> feet ( 90 m ) long . 
 The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in <unk> Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses <unk> short tons ( <unk> long tons ; <unk> t ) of structural steel to bridge the <unk> feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its <unk> at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river . The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <unk> deck <unk> bridges in the state . On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . 
 Listed on the <unk> on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – <unk> River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the <unk> River north of St. Ignace . The bridge is another <unk> arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 . Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new <unk> in the 1929 – 1930 <unk> " along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . 
 The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying <unk> Street ( BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in <unk> <unk> . Marie . Built in 1934 , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 78 m ) structure is described by MDOT as " massive " with an " innovative " construction method : the previous structure was used as a <unk> for the current bridge before removal .

 The Butterfly World Tour was the third concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey . The tour promoted Carey 's album at the time , Butterfly ( 1997 ) , and included songs from several of her previous albums . The tour visited Asia , Australia and the United States , with rehearsals taking place in December 1997 . Starting on January 11 , 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia , six in Australia , and one in Hawaii , US . Throughout the tour , Carey varied hairstyles and outfits , as well as song selections . The Butterfly World Tour was very successful ; the four dates at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under one hour , <unk> over 200 @,@ 000 tickets , breaking the previous record she held at the stadium for show sell @-@ outs . 
 The tour was recorded in VHS format , and was titled Around the World . The video featured live performances of Carey at different worldwide venues including New York , Japan , Hawaii and Brisbane . Other scenes are included in the video such as a conversation between Carey and Brenda K. Starr prior to her performance of " I Still Believe " . Prior to the performances in Australia , a scene of Carey swimming with <unk> is shown . Additionally , Olivia Newton @-@ John makes a cameo appearance during their joint performance of Newton @-@ John 's song , " <unk> <unk> to You " . The video was commercially successful , being certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and gold in Brazil by the <unk> <unk> dos <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) .

 Since her debut in 1990 , Carey had not journeyed on a large or extensive tour . In fact , she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort , Music Box ( 1993 ) , when she performed six arena shows in the United States during the Music Box Tour . The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews , mostly aimed at Carey 's deemed " obvious " stage @-@ <unk> and failure to make a connection with the crowd . <unk> nights were more favorably reviewed , with critics raving about Carey 's vocals . Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey 's live vocals , " Beyond any doubt , Ms. Carey 's voice is no studio <unk> . Her range extends from a rich , <unk> alto to dog @-@ whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns , <unk> with <unk> confidence , <unk> like a <unk> singer . " However , after the strong media attention , Carey did not visit the US on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in 1996 , visiting only Europe and Asia . The tour in contrast , received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike , as well as breaking ticket sale records . Carey 's three shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under three hours , <unk> in over 150 @,@ 000 tickets , setting the record of fastest show <unk> in Japan 's history . On the Butterfly World Tour , Carey broke the record , selling 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour . During 1997 , after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly , Carey had not planned to tour once again , due to the long travel times and strain on her voice . However , due to overwhelming demand by fans , Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again , only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia , as well as one last show in the United States . <unk> for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997 , extending for a period of two weeks .

 The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped <unk> . Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , Trey Lorenz , <unk> Daniels and Kelly Price . As the introduction began with " <unk> " , each of the <unk> were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini @-@ dress and matching sheer <unk> and <unk> heels . As she began performing " <unk> " , the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song 's performance . After an intimate performance with <unk> lights for " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance of " My All " . Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My Eyes " , the only sitting performance of the show . During the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage . 
 For the second part of the show , Carey had the second costume change of the evening , donning a long <unk> black gown and semi @-@ <unk> hair . For the performance of " <unk> " , Carey was joined by three female back @-@ up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song . The next song on the set @-@ list was " Hero " , which featured Carey alone on @-@ stage , without any vocal back @-@ up . After the song 's performance , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by Lorenz , who performed " I 'll Be There " alongside her .

On @-@ stage , Carey was joined by a full church choir , all dressed in long black garments . After the song 's <unk> , Carey performed " One Sweet Day " , alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995 . 
 After completing the song , Carey changed to a pair of leg @-@ hugging blue <unk> and a tank top . Her next performance was the " Fantasy " remix , featuring <unk> ' Dirty <unk> on a large projection screen behind the stage , as Carey performed light chair dance @-@ routines alongside several male dancers .

 <unk> <unk> , also known as Button 's Mill is a Grade II * listed tower mill constructed of brick . The <unk> is located at <unk> , Suffolk , England . It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour . <unk> <unk> worked by wind power until 1924 , <unk> on two sails , after which it became <unk> . 
 In 1979 , a group of enthusiasts purchased <unk> <unk> for restoration . Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight @-@ year period . The mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site . 
 The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and <unk> by a <unk> . It drives two pairs of <unk> , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 The <unk> at <unk> was built by <unk> George <unk> for William Button in 1819 . It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane , <unk> , Norfolk the previous year . The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819 . In 1832 , the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast @-@ iron <unk> , Patent sails and a <unk> . The new <unk> was fitted on 16 July 1832 . It was made by J <unk> , the Kings Lynn <unk> , and weighs 1 <unk> tons ( 1 @,@ 780 kg ) . A new stock was fitted in September 1836 . William Button died on 11 February 1837 . The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard . Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk in 1862 . 
 The mill was worked by Stephen <unk> , Richard 's son . He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879 . In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the <unk> . Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of <unk> on the ground floor . This was replaced in 1914 by a <unk> oil engine . Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to <unk> Vincent , a retired <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk . The <unk> engine was sold in the early 1920s . The mill was <unk> <unk> , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 . One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again <unk> . 
 On the death of <unk> Vincent in 1932 , his son George inherited the property . He lived at the site in an old <unk> until his death in 1973 . The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs <unk> , who intended to convert it into a house . They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration . In 1976 , the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale . <unk> <unk> was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979 , and plans for restoration were made . The consortium consisted of Mark <unk> , Charles <unk> , Peter <unk> , David <unk> and Chris <unk> . The <unk> mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @,@ 000 .

 The mill was restored over a period of six years . Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill . 
 
 = = = 1979 – 1980 = = = 
 
 The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979 . The first priority was to make the mill as <unk> as possible . <unk> sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure . The mill was surveyed and recorded . In spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . <unk> was erected to allow the <unk> to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame . 
 A two @-@ week work @-@ in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980 . Thirty @-@ three volunteers worked on the mill over the work @-@ in . Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from <unk> of pitch pine which had previously been in a <unk> at Bury St <unk> . On 3 August 1980 , the <unk> and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast @-@ iron curb sections . 
 New oak <unk> were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower . The bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was <unk> . A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired . New oak <unk> were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused . One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail . Some of the <unk> were made from pitch pine from the <unk> <unk> , which , following its collapse on 19 February 1977 , had been re @-@ erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life , <unk> . The <unk> hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new <unk> were made for some of the windows . A <unk> was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter . The <unk> on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of <unk> was removed . 
 The work was financed by grants of £ 500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex , £ 250 from St <unk> Borough Council , £ 200 from the <unk> Trust , and £ 200 from the Suffolk Mills Group . Other donations and income amounted to £ 65 , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners . 
 The " work @-@ in " was reported in both local and national media , including BBC Look East , Bury Free Press , Eastern Daily Press , East Anglian Daily Times , Daily Telegraph , and Radio Orwell . 
 
 = = = 1981 = = = 
 
 In the 1981 season two separate work @-@ ins were held , the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August . A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks . 
 The <unk> were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired . One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles , and over a third of the <unk> beam was replaced with oak . The six supports for the <unk> frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above . One post required replacement . It had <unk> and the floor had sunk by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to fracture . When this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed . 
 The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was <unk> . The stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those <unk> that were fit for reuse . Other <unk> were made new from oak or pitch pine . New <unk> were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick <unk> boards being double @-@ grooved with a metal tongue between them . Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a <unk> attached to the upright shaft . 
 During the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double @-@ grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete <unk> cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . The <unk> , the curb segments and <unk> <unk> were given two coats of red lead paint . A new <unk> for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter . A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and <unk> with <unk> mortar . 
 After the work @-@ in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn . The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @,@ 250 . <unk> received were £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> , £ 1 @,@ <unk> from the Historic Buildings Council and £ 130 from St <unk> Borough Council . Other donations and income received amounted to £ 70 . The project received further coverage in local media , the Eastern Daily Press , and South Norfolk News .

 The 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August . The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the <unk> curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . The cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 . It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the <unk> into position .

 Work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various <unk> and overhaul of the various parts of the <unk> <unk> and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails . The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including one from the Wind and <unk> Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) stones , including <unk> the stone nut and replacement of three <unk> in beech . 
 When the weather improved , work commenced outside . The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @-@ in commenced . The work @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people participating . During the first work @-@ in , the <unk> posts and <unk> were fitted . The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated <unk> were fitted and the <unk> was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . <unk> <unk> of oak were fitted and the <unk> was pulled into position using a <unk> . The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and <unk> . The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . 
 Between the two work @-@ ins , the rear <unk> was completed and the fitting of <unk> to the cap frame completed . This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work @-@ in . The boards for the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the <unk> , <unk> towards the top . A new neck bearing was installed under the <unk> , not without difficulty and much <unk> before it would fit . When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . The <unk> was drawn into position using a rope and <unk> , and the <unk> steel reinforcing band <unk> into position , producing a <unk> structure . The striking rod was fitted through the <unk> and the axle for the <unk> fitted in position on top of the <unk> posts . At the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates <unk> into position . <unk> of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work @-@ in . 
 After the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October . The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern <unk> paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain <unk> , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on . A mini work @-@ in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend . Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . The <unk> was removed and the <unk> dismantled . The 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people . The fitting of the cap was <unk> with beer from <unk> <unk> , <unk> . 
 Restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 @,@ <unk> . Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums , <unk> ' Norton Women 's Institute , Ipswich Historical Transport Society , the National Association for <unk> Children , Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by <unk> <unk> .

 Four work @-@ ins were held during 1984 . The first two were by <unk> from Eastern Electricity Board . <unk> <unk> was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person 's Development Project for that year . <unk> <unk> had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the Suffolk Preservation Trust , had suggested that <unk> <unk> would be a good candidate for the scheme . Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill . A <unk> electricity supply was provided . An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were <unk> a thrust <unk> which had been developed at their research facility at <unk> Heath . The thrust <unk> laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) of <unk> through which the <unk> cable was pulled into position . The mill was then supplied with lights and <unk> on each floor . 
 Other work undertaken by the <unk> involved repairing some <unk> damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising <unk> . A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . A 21 horsepower ( 16 kW ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fitting it was then painted . Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary . 
 Off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and <unk> were made . The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 . The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their <unk> speed . When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails . The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . The brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original <unk> , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) in diameter . The opinion of professional <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . The original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron . When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for <unk> . 
 The <unk> was made . Some of the small <unk> were replaced . The stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from Douglas fir . Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ in began . New beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft . 
 The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks . A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were required instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options . Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or <unk> stocks . Good quality pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths required . Douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <unk> grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years . Thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made . 
 The 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from Douglas fir . All timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> . It was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber . The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the <unk> . <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . The stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs . 
 The four sails were made . The originals being slightly different pairs . Those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . It was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch . Four 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long <unk> were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> at Bury St <unk> . The <unk> are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end . <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . The <unk> for the sail bars were cut . That at the heel of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar . Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in . 
 The <unk> and associated <unk> was fitted to the mill . At the end of the second work @-@ in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand <unk> . The <unk> itself , with the <unk> painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . The <unk> arm brake wheel was assembled around the <unk> . It was found that the <unk> was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) . When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 <unk> of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true . The <unk> for the stocks were <unk> from a <unk> of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year . Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting <unk> and further <unk> on the brickwork . The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @-@ in . The stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the <unk> and when <unk> in position and the <unk> had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . The process was repeated for the second pair of sails . The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @-@ in . 
 Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the <unk> and sorting out <unk> troubles with the <unk> <unk> . The brake and brake lever were made and installed and <unk> <unk> for the sails were cast . 
 Restoration work in 1984 cost £ 2 @,@ 918 . Grants received were £ 1 @,@ <unk> from English Heritage , £ 500 from St <unk> Borough Council , Other donations amounted to £ 52 . <unk> from open days at the mill came to £ 151 . A boost to the funds was £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> . This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a <unk> post mill buck to <unk> . In the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and Mr <unk> allowed the donation to remain with the <unk> Mill Preservation Trust . The project received further support in local media , including the East Anglian Daily Times , one of the work @-@ ins being featured on <unk> Television 's About <unk> programme .

 " <unk> Mouth " was directed by Andrew <unk> , and was written by Walt <unk> , Paul <unk> , and <unk> Williams . <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors , and Carson <unk> , William <unk> and Erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists . Series creator Stephen <unk> has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through . " Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers ' own experiences from childhood . The episode originally aired on <unk> in the United States on September 21 , 2001 . The episode marks the introduction of Mr. <unk> ' mother , Mama <unk> , who was voiced by former <unk> <unk> creative producer and current executive producer Paul <unk> . 
 The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . The idea for " <unk> Mouth " was inspired by creative director Derek <unk> 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother . " <unk> said , " The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. <unk> to <unk> , with <unk> chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . " The end of the episode , where Mr. <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and Patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ <unk> 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself . " 
 The scene where <unk> and Patrick playing a game of <unk> and <unk> , which is a parody of <unk> and <unk> , was difficult for the crew to <unk> , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . According to the series ' season 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had <unk> saying " Go ' <unk> noise ' yourself " followed by Patrick saying " ' <unk> noise ' you too ! " during the <unk> and <unk> game . It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience . 
 " <unk> Mouth " was released on the DVD compilation called <unk> <unk> : Sea Stories on March 12 , 2002 . It was also included in the <unk> <unk> : The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19 , 2004 .

 According to a report titled Wolves in <unk> 's <unk> , which documents the increase in potentially violent , <unk> , and sexual content in children 's programming , the Parents Television Council , a <unk> media group , and fans believed the <unk> <unk> episode " <unk> Mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and <unk> use of <unk> among children . The episode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , ironically the season in which the PTC named <unk> <unk> among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of <unk> among children . In a later report , several members of the PTC listed " <unk> Mouth " as an example of how levels of <unk> , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming . <unk> , in response to the incident , said " It 's sad and a little desperate that they <unk> to literally putting <unk> language in the mouths of our characters to make a point .

 = Military history of Australia = 
 
 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
 As British <unk> , the Australian colonies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , including in the Sinai , Persian Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts . 
 
 = = War and Australian society = = 
 
 For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence Australian society to this day . War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac spirit . These ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges . 
 Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious . Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes . Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . These <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .

 = = = British Forces in Australia , 1788 – 1870 = = = 
 
 From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces . Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps . The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land . Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result , in January 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia . By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . 
 Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating <unk> , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in 1854 on the Victorian <unk> . Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India , Afghanistan , New Zealand and the Sudan . 
 During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station , based in Sydney . However , in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> , marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia . The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people . 
 
 = = = Frontier warfare , 1788 – 1934 = = = 
 
 The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . By and large neither the British nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units . Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
 Fighting between <unk> and Europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance . As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century . This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in Australia . Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western Australia in 1834 . Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . 
 It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by Europeans on <unk> . Although many more <unk> died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . The <unk> were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasions large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> . However , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the Europeans . 
 Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms . However , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms . Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . These deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs . Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available . These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved successful . The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
 The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia . Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s . As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s . In Tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s . The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 . The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900 . In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s . One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished . Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .

 From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men . Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . 
 Despite a reputation of colonial <unk> , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry . As a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria <unk> the proposal . These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
 With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First <unk> War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the <unk> Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia . 
 
 = = = Sudan , 1885 = = = 
 
 During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahdi to his followers . In 1883 , as part of the <unk> War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of <unk> their forces . The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales <unk> consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 . 
 The contingent arrived in <unk> on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots , <unk> and <unk> Guards . They subsequently marched for <unk> in a large " square " formation made up of 10 @,@ 000 men . Reaching the village , they burned <unk> and returned to <unk> : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting . Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards <unk> , on the Nile . The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered . They <unk> on a reconnaissance to <unk> on 6 May and were heavily involved in a <unk> during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured . On 15 May , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March . Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at <unk> and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at <unk> . 
 Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in <unk> . The New South Wales <unk> sailed for home on 17 May , arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 . Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . 
 
 = = = Second Boer War , 1899 – 1902 = = = 
 
 British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the <unk> <unk> and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the Second Boer War in 1899 . Pre @-@ <unk> the deployment of British forces , the <unk> <unk> of the Orange Free State and the <unk> Republic under President Paul <unk> declared war on 11 October 1899 , striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony . After the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate <unk> to serve with British formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria , and one each from the other colonies . The first troops arrived three weeks later , with the New South Wales <unk> — who had been training in England before the war , <unk> diverted to South Africa . On 22 November , the <unk> came under fire for the first time near <unk> , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them . 
 Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved . The first <unk> of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles <unk> . With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front . The first casualties occurred soon after at <unk> on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians , British and artillery attacked a Boer <unk> at <unk> . <unk> David <unk> and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward <unk> . Regardless , the <unk> were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner . Five hundred <unk> and the New South Wales <unk> subsequently took part in the Siege of <unk> in February 1900 . 
 Despite serious set @-@ backs at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in January — and with <unk> still under siege — the British mounted a five division counter @-@ invasion of the Orange Free State in February . The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales <unk> , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached . First , <unk> was relieved following the battles of <unk> River and <unk> , and the retreating <unk> defeated at <unk> , with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general , <unk> <unk> . The British entered <unk> on 13 March 1900 , while <unk> was relieved . Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . Still the advance continued , with the drive to <unk> in May including more than 3 @,@ 000 Australians . Johannesburg fell on 30 May , and the <unk> withdrew from <unk> on 3 June . The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June . <unk> was relieved on 17 May . 
 Following the defeat of the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military discipline . Such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry " <unk> " <unk> and Peter <unk> served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . 
 With the guerrillas requiring supplies , <unk> de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 <unk> against <unk> , on the <unk> River in Western <unk> . The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 <unk> . The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties . During the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . A relief force was stopped by the <unk> , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into the post . After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the <unk> eventually retired . The Siege of <unk> River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August . 
 In response the British adopted counter @-@ insurgency tactics , including a <unk> earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of <unk> and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications . Such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the British , however they soon yielded results . By mid @-@ 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer <unk> or <unk> , overwhelming them with superior numbers . <unk> of warfare in last months of 1901 , the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled 1 @,@ <unk> miles ( 2 @,@ <unk> km ) and were involved in 13 <unk> , killing 27 <unk> , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded . Other notable Australian actions included <unk> , Pink Hill , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . On 12 June 1901 , the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at <unk> , near <unk> after poor security allowed a force of 150 <unk> to surprise them . On 30 October 1901 , <unk> of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , although 60 <unk> were also killed in the engagement . Meanwhile , at <unk> on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Queensland Imperial <unk> lost 13 killed and 17 wounded . Ultimately the <unk> were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 . In all 16 @,@ 175 Australians served in South Africa , and perhaps another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded . Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 
 = = = <unk> Rebellion , 1900 – 01 = = = 
 
 The <unk> Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William <unk> . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained in both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> Marine Light Infantry . 
 The <unk> from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900 . Arriving in <unk> , the Australians provided 300 men to an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at <unk> Tang , which dominated a key railway . They arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at <unk> @-@ <unk> Fu , where the Chinese government was believed to have found <unk> after <unk> was captured by western forces . The <unk> joined a force of 7 @,@ 500 men on a ten @-@ day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered . The <unk> then garrisoned <unk> and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in <unk> . HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and <unk> duties in the Gulf of <unk> , before departing in November . The naval brigades remained during the winter , <unk> performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as <unk> and fire @-@ fighters . They left China in March 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order . Six Australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action . 
 
 = = Australian military forces at Federation , 1901 = = 
 
 The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies . Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . The co @-@ ordination of Australia @-@ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind <unk> , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result , while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established . 
 The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force . 28 @,@ <unk> colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18 @,@ 603 paid militia and 8 @,@ <unk> unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation . This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia . However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( <unk> ) . Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work <unk> an integrated structure for the new army . In 1911 , following a report by Lord <unk> the Royal Military College , <unk> was established , as was a system of universal National Service . 
 Prior to federation each self @-@ governing colony had operated its own naval force . These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to <unk> the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and <unk> , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested <unk> that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser <unk> Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force . 
 The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . Regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .

 When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War , the Australian government rapidly followed suit , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that " ... when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia " and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia . This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citizens and first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time . Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain . 
 As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , an all @-@ volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 . The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . <unk> and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under <unk> plans drawn up in 1912 . The first commander was Major General William Bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st Division . Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed .

 Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies . The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( <unk> & <unk> ) , a 2000 @-@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval <unk> and ex @-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes . The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on <unk> , and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands , and at Rabaul in German New Guinea . The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at <unk> <unk> and <unk> . German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 . Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine <unk> with all 35 men aboard . 
 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 
 The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914 . During the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — <unk> Sydney — engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS <unk> at the Battle of <unk> on 8 November , in the first ship @-@ to @-@ ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy . Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front , the Australians were instead sent to British @-@ controlled Egypt to pre @-@ <unk> any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal , and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers . 
 <unk> to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious <unk> at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . 
 For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original <unk> , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war . 
 
 = = = Egypt and Palestine = = = 
 
 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion . In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australian 's first saw combat during the <unk> uprising in the <unk> Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties . The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pushed back . Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February . 
 The advance entered Palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April . A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part . The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers . The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . The Turkish trenches were overrun , with the Australians capturing the wells at <unk> and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded . Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at <unk> Ridge , Jerusalem and the <unk> . The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918 . Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . 
 Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the <unk> . <unk> just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however , when the <unk> Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq . The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front , where they performed well . 
 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 
 Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium , leaving Egypt in March 1916 . I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of <unk> on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation . Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the Battle of <unk> on 19 July 1916 , suffering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day . The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting <unk> , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Mouquet Farm was attacked in August , with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men . By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,@ 000 casualties in just 45 days . 
 In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of <unk> . On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of <unk> , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured . On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter @-@ attacked near <unk> and were forced to abandon the town , before <unk> it again . The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of <unk> , beginning on 3 May , and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division . Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid @-@ May . Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ <unk> Australian casualties . 
 On 7 June 1917 , the II Anzac Corps — along with two British corps — launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres . The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the <unk> ridge , destroying the German trenches . The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . Australian casualties during the Battle of <unk> included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the <unk> Plateau , between September and November 1917 . Individual actions took place at <unk> Road , <unk> Wood , <unk> , <unk> and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last @-@ <unk> effort to win the war , <unk> sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front . As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme . The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . By late May the Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris . During this time the Australians fought at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> Wood , <unk> , and Hamel . At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time . 
 The German offensive ground to a halt in mid @-@ July and a brief lull followed , during which the Australians undertook a series of raids , known as <unk> <unk> . The Allies soon launched their own offensive — the Hundred Days Offensive — ultimately ending the war . Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the " Black Day " of the German Army . The offensive continued for four months , and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mont St Quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at <unk> . The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . 
 In all <unk> @,@ <unk> Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas . 61 @,@ 508 were killed and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ <unk> @,@ <unk> @,@ <unk> . Two <unk> on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . 
 The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also . Indeed , for many Australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of Australian character and <unk> that exist today have their origins in the war . 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War .

 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( <unk> ) . <unk> repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
 The Royal Australian Navy destroyer <unk> Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 . Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , Anton <unk> in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral <unk> <unk> in Siberia . Later , they also served in Mesopotamia as part of <unk> and the <unk> Mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting . 
 Although the motivations of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for <unk> and courage , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia .

The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other <unk> , such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion , rather than forming their own units . Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were Spanish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — <unk> Bull , a conservative <unk> who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War — known to have fought for General Francisco Franco 's Nationalist forces . 
 While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . Australian opposition to the Republican cause was <unk> by <unk> <unk> on an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ Nationalist basis . <unk> , although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels , they received no public support . Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist , no action was taken . Consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the <unk> and Services League of Australia ( <unk> ) . Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

 Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 . At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and <unk> for war . <unk> for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) began in mid @-@ September . While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 . Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the Middle East . The RAAF 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the war . 
 The Australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa . During 1940 the light cruiser <unk> Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " <unk> Iron Flotilla " by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships . The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation <unk> . The division assaulted and captured <unk> on 5 January and <unk> on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured <unk> on 4 February . In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division . 
 The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece . At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete . The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies . Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt . The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October . During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign against the <unk> French . Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French <unk> in early July . 
 The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El <unk> during June and the Second Battle of El <unk> in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and <unk> warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war . 
 The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany . Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF <unk> Command between 1940 and the end of the war . Australians took part in all of <unk> Command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France . Australian aircrew in <unk> Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic . 
 
 = = = Asia and the Pacific = = = 
 
 From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " Singapore strategy " . This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region . To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia . The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters . 
 The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December . The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island . Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Over 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity . The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 296 Australian prisoners died in captivity . 
 The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland . While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia . This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March . 
 Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the <unk> Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF . Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> . The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of <unk> in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the <unk> @-@ Lae campaign in April . In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the <unk> Peninsula during the <unk> Peninsula campaign and <unk> Range campaign . 
 The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( <unk> ) . 
 Australia 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 . The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there . In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war . These campaigns contributed little to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial . 
 Following Japan 's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored . Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel . <unk> @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas . Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded . 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians .

 The <unk> of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947 . Plans for post @-@ war defence arrangements were <unk> on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved . The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force . Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces . The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947 , while the <unk> was re @-@ raised on 1 July 1948 . 
 
 = = = Occupation of Japan , 1946 – 52 = = = 
 
 In the immediate post @-@ war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( <unk> ) , which included forces from Australia , Britain , India and New Zealand . At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel . The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in <unk> Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the <unk> ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean <unk> following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 . The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-@ 51 Mustangs , initially based at <unk> from March 1946 , before transferring to <unk> in 1948 . However , by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan . A total of ten <unk> warships served in Japan during this period , including <unk> Ships Australia , Hobart , Shropshire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Murchison , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , while <unk> Ships <unk> , <unk> and <unk> also provided support .

 During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin <unk> in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and <unk> . 
 
 = = = Korean War , 1950 – 53 = = = 
 
 On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in <unk> the North Korean attack . Australia initially contributed P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the <unk> . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The <unk> frigate <unk> <unk> , and the destroyer <unk> <unk> , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard <unk> Sydney was added to the force . 
 By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North Koreans were in retreat following the <unk> landings . As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of <unk> near <unk> on 22 October , before advancing towards the <unk> River . Further successful actions followed at <unk> on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at <unk> on 29 October 1950 . North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the <unk> River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . <unk> by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at <unk> on 5 November . The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel . 
 A series of battles followed at <unk> on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital . Further fighting occurred at <unk> @-@ <unk> on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at <unk> @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive . Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of <unk> . On 22 April , Chinese forces attacked the <unk> valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw . Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance . After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded . In July 1951 , the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division . The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River . The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated . Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded . 
 The <unk> then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and <unk> forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River . Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 . The Australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a <unk> Chinese attack along the <unk> River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . <unk> were suspended on 27 July 1953 . 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured . 
 
 = = = Malayan Emergency , 1950 – 60 = = = 
 
 The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( <unk> ) . Australian involvement began in June 1950 , when in response to a British request , six <unk> from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( <unk> ) . The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as <unk> and <unk> drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases . The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation <unk> , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops . The <unk> were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing . Based at RAAF Base <unk> they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . 
 Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . In January 1956 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) . 2 RAR mainly participated in " <unk> up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade . Contact with the enemy was <unk> and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR . 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving <unk> insurgents back into the jungle of <unk> and <unk> . The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . Again contact was limited , although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor . By late 1959 , operations against the <unk> were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border . 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR . Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents , and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963 . The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960 . 
 Australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air @-@ field construction squadron . The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 . The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 Australians served and 51 died in Malaya — although only 15 were on operations — and another 27 were wounded . 
 
 = = = Military and Naval growth during the 1960s = = = 
 
 At the start of the 1960s , Prime Minister Robert <unk> greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government 's policy of " Forward Defence " in South East Asia . In 1964 , <unk> announced a large increase in defence spending . The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 @,@ 000 to 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brigade division with nine battalions . The RAAF and <unk> would also both be increased by 25 % . In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced under the National Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) . 
 In 1961 , three Charles F. Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers . Traditionally , the <unk> had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant . <unk> Perth and <unk> Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by <unk> Brisbane in 1967 . Other projects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier <unk> Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ class submarines . 
 The RAAF took delivery of their first <unk> fighters in 1967 , <unk> No. 3 , No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them . The service also received American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft , C @-@ 130 <unk> transports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian <unk> trainers . 
 
 = = = Indonesia @-@ Malaysia <unk> , 1962 – 66 = = = 
 
 The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia , with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur . As part of Australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only . On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions at <unk> and <unk> , in September and October 1964 . 
 Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo . During the early phases , British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian / Indonesian border , and to protect population centres . However , by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into <unk> to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the <unk> to remain on the defensive , under the <unk> Operation <unk> . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . 
 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in <unk> until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border . The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at Sungei <unk> , <unk> and <unk> during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the <unk> — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents . 4 RAR served a less @-@ eventful tour between April and August 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully <unk> with the <unk> on a number of occasions . A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( <unk> ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the <unk> , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . Other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of <unk> ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in <unk> <unk> in the Singapore Strait . The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated . 
 Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross @-@ border missions only occurred in 1996 . Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General <unk> to power , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@ 500 Australians served during <unk> ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . 
 
 = = = Vietnam War , 1962 – 73 = = = 
 
 Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s . As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s . In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South Vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam . Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as " The Team " . They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war . Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of <unk> transport aircraft to the port city of <unk> <unk> . 
 However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the US increased its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 . Australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US <unk> Airborne Brigade in <unk> <unk> province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang <unk> , Operation <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 <unk> ) — to replace 1 RAR . Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme . <unk> of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at <unk> <unk> , in <unk> Tuy Province . Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF . At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself . 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over <unk> Tuy Province and 1 <unk> was not fundamentally challenged again . Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during Operation <unk> . 
 Yet with the <unk> Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . 1 <unk> was subsequently deployed <unk> infiltration routes leading to Saigon to <unk> communist movement against the capital as part of Operation <unk> during the 1968 <unk> Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral – <unk> in May and June 1968 . At Fire Support <unk> Coral and <unk> the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured . Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969 , <unk> <unk> in late @-@ December 1968 and early 1969 and Long <unk> in June 1971 . At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 <unk> numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support . A third RAAF unit , No. 2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four <unk> destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam . 
 The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970 . As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations in October . Meanwhile , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of <unk> <unk> . The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 . The Vietnam War was Australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . Four were awarded the Victoria Cross .

 Although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co @-@ ordination between the services in the post @-@ war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military 's experiences in the Vietnam War . In 1973 , the Secretary of the Department of Defence , Arthur <unk> , submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff . 
 The <unk> Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence <unk> ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and Supply ) into a single Department of Defence in 1973 , while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished . On 1 January 1976 , the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified , all @-@ volunteer , professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( <unk> ) . Today , the <unk> is headquartered at Russell <unk> in Canberra and is divided into Air , Land , Maritime and Special Operations <unk> . In addition , Northern Command is based in Darwin , and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia . 
 
 = = = Defence of Australia , 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 
 Until the 1970s , Australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence , in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia 's region . Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969 , and the British withdrawal ' east of Suez ' in the early 1970s , Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence of the Australian continent . Known as the Defence of Australia Policy , it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack . 
 In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia . During this time the <unk> had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events . 
 During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons in 1988 . Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft . Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War . <unk> and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the <unk> have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of <unk> and South China Sea . They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights . 
 
 = = = Gulf War , 1991 = = = 
 
 Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some <unk> personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 . 
 
 = = = Global security , late @-@ 1990s = = = 
 
 Since the late 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards . The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests . In line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness .

 The former @-@ Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President <unk> <unk> subsequently agreed to allow the East <unk> to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 @.@ 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence . However , following the announcement of the results pro @-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and <unk> and many East <unk> were killed , while perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced . Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to <unk> , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 . 
 Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter <unk> , <unk> began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting <unk> , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations . With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from East Timor , <unk> re @-@ established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September . On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence . The hand @-@ over of command of military operations from <unk> to <unk> was completed on 28 February 2000 . Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and <unk> helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission . During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with West Timor . Significant actions occurred in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and at <unk> in October 1999 . However , with the security situation <unk> the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non @-@ battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action . 
 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the <unk> 's ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the <unk> 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the <unk> for overseas deployments . The Australian government committed to improve the <unk> 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of <unk> units , expanding the <unk> to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year . 
 In May 2006 , 2 @,@ 000 <unk> personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation <unk> , following unrest between elements of the Timor <unk> Defence Force . Australian forces were involved in a number <unk> during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by <unk> <unk> at Same on 4 March 2007 . However , by early @-@ 2010 the security situation had been <unk> and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force . Following a <unk> , the International <unk> Force commenced withdrawing from Timor @-@ <unk> in November 2012 , a process which was completed in April 2013 . 
 
 = = = Afghanistan , 2001 – present = = = 
 
 Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 , Australian forces were committed to the American @-@ led international coalition against terrorism . The <unk> 's most visible contribution — codenamed Operation <unk> — has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid @-@ 2005 to fight against the <unk> . Over time the Australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the <unk> National Army . Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP @-@ <unk> Orion surveillance aircraft and three C @-@ 130 <unk> transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation <unk> . A detachment of four F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter @-@ bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late @-@ 2001 to mid @-@ 2002 , while two Boeing <unk> air @-@ to @-@ air <unk> aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in <unk> to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in <unk> airspace but were later withdrawn . A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction <unk> in April 2007 . In addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid @-@ 2007 , with further small increases to 1 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 2008 , 1 @,@ 100 in early 2009 and 1 @,@ 550 in mid @-@ 2009 . 
 A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations in <unk> Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces , including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal . The force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements . By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion @-@ sized battle group known as the <unk> Task Force , and the Special Operations Task Group , both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of <unk> <unk> , as well as the <unk> Wing Group flying CH @-@ <unk> <unk> , the Force <unk> <unk> and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in <unk> . In addition , a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support , but are located outside of Afghanistan . Meanwhile , <unk> of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , based out of Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates . Also included is the deployment of one of the <unk> 's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties . 
 Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation <unk> in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006 , as well as actions in <unk> in 2007 , <unk> in 2009 , the Shah <unk> <unk> and <unk> in 2010 , and <unk> in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army . Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years . Following a <unk> in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in <unk> and <unk> . Over 26 @,@ 000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan .

 Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just 2 @,@ <unk> personnel — codenamed Operation <unk> . Major force elements included special forces , <unk> and fixed wing aviation and naval units . Army units included elements from the <unk> and 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) , a CH @-@ 47 <unk> detachment and a number of other specialist units . <unk> units included the amphibious ship <unk> <unk> and the frigates <unk> Darwin and <unk> Anzac , while the RAAF deployed 14 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron , a number of AP @-@ <unk> <unk> and C @-@ 130 <unk> . The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the <unk> . During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War , with No. 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser @-@ guided bombs . 
 The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn . While Australia did not initially take part in the post @-@ war occupation of Iraq , an Australian Army light armoured <unk> — designated the Al <unk> Task Group and including 40 <unk> light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation <unk> . The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units . The <unk> later became the <unk> Battle Group ( West ) ( <unk> ( W ) ) , following the hand back of Al <unk> province to Iraqi control . Force levels peaked at 1 @,@ 400 personnel in May 2007 including the <unk> ( W ) in Southern Iraq , the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team — Iraq . A <unk> frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf , while RAAF assets included C @-@ <unk> <unk> and AP @-@ <unk> elements . Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin <unk> the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid @-@ 2009 , while RAAF and <unk> operations were <unk> to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation <unk> . 
 Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of <unk> under Operation <unk> . <unk> was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq . Although more than 17 @,@ 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force . A further 27 personnel were wounded . Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation <unk> . This operation concluded in November 2013 .

 In June 2014 a small number of <unk> personnel were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive . Later , in August and September a number of RAAF C @-@ 17 and C @-@ <unk> transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct <unk> of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to <unk> arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish @-@ controlled northern Iraq . In late September 2014 an Air Task Group ( <unk> ) and Special Operations Task Group ( <unk> ) were deployed to Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq . <unk> with F / A @-@ <unk> Super <unk> strike aircraft , a <unk> @-@ <unk> Multi Role <unk> Transport , and an E @-@ <unk> <unk> Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft , the <unk> began operations on 1 October . The <unk> is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces , and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments . It began moving into Iraq in early November . In April 2015 a 300 @-@ strong unit known as Task Group <unk> was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces . <unk> were extended to Syria in September 2015 .

 Australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both United Nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad @-@ hoc coalitions . Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as <unk> ; however " in comparative international terms , Australia has only been a moderately energetic <unk> . " Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years — being among the first group of UN military observers in Indonesia in 1947 — its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high @-@ level and technical support troops such as <unk> , engineers , <unk> , observers , and police . One significant commitment has been Australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running <unk> Force and Observers in the Sinai . The operational tempo started increasing in the mid @-@ 1990s , when Australia became involved in a series of high @-@ profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor , and the Solomon Islands .

 = Ward Churchill = 
 
 Ward <unk> Churchill ( born 1947 ) is an American author and political activist . He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007 . The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government . His work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often <unk> style . 
 In January 2005 , Churchill 's work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a 2001 essay , " On the Justice of <unk> <unk> " , in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and <unk> consequence of unlawful US foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century ; the essay is well known for Churchill 's use of the phrase " little <unk> " to describe the " <unk> corps " working in the World Trade Center . 
 In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research <unk> ; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so . Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little <unk> " comment . Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment . In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was wrongly fired , <unk> him $ 1 in damages . In July 2009 , a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his <unk> , deciding the university has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " . In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's decision . In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling . In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ' decisions in favor of the University of Colorado . On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case . 
 In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the northern plains / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 . Churchill also stated that he had a half @-@ dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next three years . 
 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 
 Churchill was born in <unk> , Illinois , to Jack <unk> Churchill and <unk> <unk> Allen . His parents divorced before he was two , and he grew up in <unk> , where he attended local schools . 
 In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States Army . On his 1980 resume , he said he served as a public @-@ information specialist who " wrote and edited the battalion <unk> and wrote news releases . " 
 In a 1987 profile on Churchill , the Denver Post reported that he was drafted , went to paratrooper school , then volunteered for Vietnam , where he served a 10 @-@ month tour as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ( <unk> ) , one of a six @-@ man team sent out to track down the enemy . The Post article also reported that Churchill was politically <unk> as a result of his experiences in Vietnam . Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the Chicago office of the Students for a Democratic Society ( <unk> ) in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the Weather Underground how to build bombs and fire weapons . 
 In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film <unk> and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or <unk> training . The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a <unk> team . 
 Churchill received his <unk> in technological communications in 1974 and <unk> in communications theory in 1975 , both from <unk> State University , now the University of Illinois at Springfield . 
 
 = = Career = = 
 
 In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Boulder as an <unk> action officer in the university administration . He also <unk> on American Indian issues in the ethnic studies program . In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . The following year he was granted tenure in the Communications department , without the usual six @-@ year <unk> period , after having been declined by the Sociology and Political Science departments . 
 He has long been interested in issues associated with the <unk> Act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . <unk> with that was the federal government 's first use of " blood quantum " to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the <unk> Rolls . Since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , <unk> recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . Some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of <unk> against Native Americans . 
 In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with David <unk> in an interview : 
 You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in <unk> @-@ America . But in Anglo @-@ America , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the General <unk> Act , mid @-@ 1880s . At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was <unk> and <unk> of at least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group . You couldn 't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth <unk> and be an Indian . You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter <unk> or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . The reason for this was quite clear . They were identifying Indians for purposes of <unk> them individual <unk> of land in the existing reservation base at that point . If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus . So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of <unk> that would minimize the number of Indians that were available . It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to <unk> in the first place . It 's become increasingly so ever since . " ( David <unk> ( December 1995 ) . " Interview with Ward Churchill : Historical and Current <unk> " . Z Magazine . ) 
 In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new <unk> Studies Department of the University of Colorado . In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002 . 
 In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado — his term as chair was scheduled to <unk> in June of that year . On May 16 , 2006 , the <unk> Committee of the Standing Committee on Research <unk> at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of academic <unk> , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and <unk> . On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic <unk> in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado 's Board of <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> and <unk> affiliation = = 
 
 In 2003 , Churchill stated , " I am myself of <unk> and Creek descent on my father 's side , <unk> on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member of the United <unk> Band of <unk> Indians . " In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth Creek and one @-@ sixteenth <unk> . In 1993 , Churchill told the Colorado Daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth Creek and <unk> . " Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 In a statement dated May 9 , 2005 , and posted on its website , the United <unk> Band initially said , 
 " The United <unk> Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> Band and was only given an honorary ' associate membership ' in the early 1990s because he could not prove any <unk> ancestry . " The tribe said that all of Churchill 's " past , present and future claims or <unk> of <unk> ' enrollment , ' written or spoken , including but not limited to ; biographies , curriculum <unk> , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed <unk> , are deemed <unk> by the United <unk> Band . " 
 Two days later , the United <unk> Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill 's " alleged ancestry " of being <unk> : 
 " Because Mr. Churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the <unk> in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an ' Associate <unk> ' as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " However , Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for <unk> Nation of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 <unk> . " 
 The tribe 's spokesperson , Lisa <unk> , stated the tribe <unk> only members with certified one @-@ quarter American Indian blood . The website statement further clarified that Churchill " was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' Certificate of <unk> of Indian Blood ( <unk> ) " , and the associate membership did not <unk> an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . 
 Churchill has never asked for <unk> certification , and finds the idea of being " <unk> " by the US government offensive . 
 In June 1994 , the United <unk> Band had voted to stop <unk> associate <unk> . Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not <unk> an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . The <unk> Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , <unk> Berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe . 
 In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history . It " turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records . The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents . The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . Numerous members of Churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of Indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who were identified . 
 <unk> in Churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a " special opportunity position . " In 1994 , then <unk> @-@ Boulder Chancellor James <unk> refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was <unk> claiming to be an Indian , saying " it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . " 
 Some of Churchill 's Native American critics , such as Vernon <unk> ( White Earth Ojibwe ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Southern Cheyenne @-@ <unk> Creek ) , argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute <unk> and grounds for termination . The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The University of Colorado 's Research <unk> Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . " The committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research <unk> . " 
 In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News , Churchill said , " I have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said I was . And even if [ the critics ] are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue ? I have never claimed to be <unk> <unk> Bull . " The longtime indigenous activist Russell <unk> said in February of that year , " So I want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have <unk> that Ward Churchill is a full @-@ <unk> Indian leader . " 
 
 = = = Blood quantum = = = 
 
 Churchill has responded to requests for <unk> of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements . Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of <unk> in order to further goals of personal <unk> and political <unk> . 
 For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent <unk> purpose . He says , 
 " Set the blood quantum at one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians , let <unk> proceed as it [ has ] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence " . 
 Churchill 's <unk> have been raised as one of the several research @-@ <unk> allegations that were brought against him in 2005 ( see below ) . He has been accused of using his interpretation of the <unk> Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member . 
 
 = = Writing = = 
 
 Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and speaks about <unk> inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day . 
 As of 2007 , according to a report submitted on his behalf , Churchill has written 10 books on his own and co @-@ authored 4 . Some have been reprinted with updates . He has written 51 book chapters , 3 law reviews , and 50 scholarly essays ; 27 of these were <unk> . He has edited 4 volumes and co @-@ edited 3 more . 
 According to the University of Colorado investigation , " His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and <unk> , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not <unk> describing new research based on primary sources . " The investigation also noted that " he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer @-@ reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics . " In addition to his academic writing , Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion . 
 In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled <unk> as <unk> : Notes on an American <unk> criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being <unk> , de facto racist and <unk> . In 1998 , <unk> Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled <unk> as <unk> : Reflections on the Role of Armed <unk> in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead , a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan . The book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ <unk> movement in the following few years . 
 Agents of <unk> ( 1988 ) , co @-@ authored by Jim <unk> Wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and ' 70s by the FBI under the <unk> program . The <unk> <unk> ( 1990 ; reissued 2002 ) , also co @-@ authored with Jim <unk> Wall , examines a series of original FBI <unk> that detail the Bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s . 
 In Fantasies of the Master Race ( 1992 ) , Churchill examines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in popular American culture . He focuses on such phenomena as Tony <unk> 's mystery novels , the film <unk> with Wolves , and the New Age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation . Churchill calls author Carlos <unk> 's claims of revealing the teachings of a <unk> Indian <unk> , the " greatest hoax since <unk> Man . " 
 <unk> for the Land ( 1993 ; reissued 2002 ) is a collection of essays in which Churchill chronicles what he describes as the U.S. government 's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians . He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent <unk> and industrial practices such as surface mining . 
 Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics . He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian <unk> killings , the prosecution of Leonard <unk> , sports <unk> , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of <unk> . Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age <unk> of <unk> and American Indian sacred traditions , and the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself <unk> " of certain contemporary authors . John P. <unk> of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian Quarterly . Professor <unk> , an enrolled member of the <unk> Sioux Nation , states that Indians Are Us ? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes . It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade . The claim has been criticized as a <unk> . Churchill has , however , received support from some scholars . 
 From a Native Son : Selected Essays on <unk> , 1985 – 1995 ( 1996 ) is a collection of 23 previously published essays on Native American history , culture , and political activism . In his introduction to this volume , Howard <unk> <unk> " the emergence of a new generation of Native @-@ American scholars " and describes Churchill 's writing as " powerful , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> and deception " . 
 Churchill 's A Little <unk> of <unk> ( 1997 ) is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the Americas from <unk> to the present . He compares the treatment of North American Indians to historical instances of <unk> by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , Turks against <unk> , and Europeans against the <unk> , as well as Nazis against the Poles and Jews . 
 In <unk> of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U.S. ' s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people . <unk> the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non @-@ Indians in the U.S. , but later adapted for application abroad . He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U.S. ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of <unk> " to establish colonial control and empire . 
 Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the Justice of <unk> <unk> : Reflections on the <unk> of U.S. Imperial <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) by AK Press . The book features two other chapters , one listing US military <unk> , another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law . The original essay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy <unk> as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U.S. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries . 
 In Kill the Indian , Save the Man : The <unk> Impact of American Indian Residential Schools ( 2004 ) , Churchill traces the history of removing American Indian children from their homes to residential schools ( in Canada ) or Indian boarding schools ( in the USA ) as part of government policies ( 1880s – 1980s ) which he regards as <unk> .

 Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co @-@ director of the Denver @-@ based American Indian Movement of Colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the American Indian Movement . In 1993 , he and other local <unk> leaders , including Russell <unk> , Glenn T. Morris , Robert <unk> , and David Hill , broke with the national <unk> leadership , including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde <unk> , claiming that all <unk> chapters are autonomous . The <unk> Grand <unk> Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group . It says that the schism arose when <unk> , Churchill , Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the <unk> Indian group <unk> , who were allied with the anti @-@ revolutionary , CIA @-@ backed <unk> . 
 Journalists such as <unk> <unk> attributed the split to <unk> and other <unk> members dividing over opposition to the <unk> brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of Anna <unk> <unk> in December 1975 , who was then the highest @-@ ranking woman in <unk> but had been suspected of being an informant . It was a year in which other FBI <unk> had been discovered in <unk> . On November 3 , 1999 , <unk> held a press conference in Denver , Colorado in which he accused the <unk> brothers of <unk> in <unk> 's death , and named three lower @-@ level <unk> members involved in her death : <unk> Looking Cloud , John Graham , and <unk> Nelson Clark . This was the first time that an <unk> leader active at the time of the <unk> murder had publicly accused <unk> of having been involved . 
 Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dakota state <unk> , respectively . By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . <unk> attributed the split in <unk> to divisions in the aftermath of <unk> 's murder . The journalist <unk> <unk> said in 1999 , " ... her [ <unk> 's ] death has divided the American Indian Movement ... " 
 The schism continued , with the national <unk> leadership claiming that the local <unk> leaders , such as Churchill , are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians . The leaders of the national <unk> organization , now called <unk> Grand <unk> Council , claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter @-@ intelligence source for the U.S. government , for example the FBI , and local , non @-@ Indian , police forces , to <unk> the national <unk> organization . Specifically , they refer to a 1993 Boulder , Colorado interview with <unk> <unk> , a former columnist for the Denver Post , in which Churchill stated that he " was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement . " In addition , Vernon <unk> accused Churchill of having ' <unk> represented himself as an Indian ' to bolster his credentials . <unk> said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986 . 
 Churchill has been a leader of Colorado <unk> 's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its associated parade . Colorado <unk> 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 , Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the <unk> Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , <unk> the First Amendment rights of non @-@ Native Americans .

 Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of <unk> <unk> . In it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U.S. foreign policy . He compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in " ongoing <unk> American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf <unk> in organizing the Holocaust . In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized when Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak . This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of <unk> by Churchill and supporters . Following the controversy , the University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil <unk> said , " While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on 9 / 11 has outraged and <unk> us and the general public . " 
 A documentary called <unk> Fire : Stories from the Edge of Free Speech , broadcast on HBO , prominently features Churchill 's case in addressing the issues of free speech and First Amendment rights .

 The controversy attracted increased academic attention to Churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar John <unk> and historian <unk> <unk> . Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown , who had been preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and the historians <unk> Robertson and Russell <unk> , who claimed that Churchill had misrepresented their work . In 2005 , University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research <unk> , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or <unk> regarding the history of the <unk> Act , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in <unk> and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 ( not to be confused with the well @-@ documented use of smallpox @-@ infected blankets at Fort Pitt in 1764 ) . 
 On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the <unk> Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research <unk> " , including <unk> , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . The Standing Committee on Research <unk> accepted the findings of the <unk> Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's <unk> and <unk> Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of <unk> did not constitute <unk> offences . Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal . 
 On July 24 , 2007 , the University <unk> voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research <unk> , <unk> the recommendation of <unk> and <unk> panel that two be dismissed . By a vote of eight to one , the <unk> determined to fire Churchill . 
 The next day , Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was <unk> for his expressing politically unpopular views . The jury in Churchill 's suit for <unk> weighed the university 's claims of academic <unk> per jury instructions it received in the case . As Stanley Fish said , " It was the jury ’ s task to determine whether Churchill ’ s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his <unk> protected statements . " The jury found that the alleged <unk> would not have led to Churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic <unk> claim as the grounds for dismissal . On April 1 , 2009 , a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ 1 in damages . As one of the jurors said later in a press interview , " it wasn 't a <unk> in his face or anything like that when we didn 't give him any money . It 's just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David Lane kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that . " Churchill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. <unk> of the Denver District Court to order <unk> in light of the verdict . 
 On July 7 , 2009 , Judge <unk> found that the defendants ( university ) were entitled to quasi @-@ judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation . <unk> denied Churchill 's request for <unk> at <unk> . 
 Churchill appealed both decisions . On November 24 , 2010 , a three @-@ judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision . In February 2011 , Churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court . In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear his case . Court records indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 . On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , upholding the trial court 's ruling . On April 1 , 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Churchill .

 Churchill 's subjects are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture . He uses historical photographs as source material for works . In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market , Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and <unk> Act . It requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an <unk> . Under federal law , Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American . 
 Some of Churchill 's pieces may <unk> <unk> . For example , his 1981 <unk> Winter Attack was , according to Churchill and others , based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. <unk> Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them . Other copies are available online for purchase . Churchill says that , when he produced Winter Attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on <unk> ' work . The online journal <unk> mentions Churchill 's artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality .

 = Fort Scott National Historic Site = 
 
 Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the United States National Park Service in Bourbon County , Kansas , United States . Named after General Winfield Scott , who achieved <unk> during the Mexican @-@ American War , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for US Army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 . For the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement , a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War . 
 The current national historic site protects 20 historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m ² ) of restored <unk> prairie , inside the city of Fort Scott . It is open to visitors most days of the year . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort <unk> and Fort Gibson . It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians , as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment . 
 The United States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to <unk> on the Indian settlements . Fort Scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the Civil War . 
 
 = = = Army days = = = 
 
 The <unk> of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity . After some delay , the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort <unk> and the site . The Army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage <unk> section of modern @-@ day Kansas . After <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 . 
 Unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide @-@ open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . These buildings were on the edges of a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground . 
 The post <unk> , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees . He had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming . Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction . As a result , only one <unk> of the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel George <unk> reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above average " . 
 Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican @-@ American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still uncompleted , officials decided on April 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and $ 35 @,@ 000 . By the time it was finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley . 
 For the average soldier , life at the fort was " <unk> " . Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords . Five miles East in Missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> at the shop . The <unk> rate from the fort ranged from 12 % <unk> % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . Hunting was a popular <unk> ; according to Captain Swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place . 
 
 = = = Bleeding Kansas = = = 
 
 Two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . In 1854 the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri <unk> of 1820 , which had kept slavery out of Kansas . <unk> in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery . Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out . Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free @-@ Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro @-@ <unk> at the Western Hotel . Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free @-@ soil side . During this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted <unk> , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting .

 During the American Civil War , the fort was renewed as a US military post . In August 1861 , the Union Army took command of Fort Scott , and <unk> it for the war times . The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for <unk> and <unk> functions . The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners . Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , and Wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to <unk> Missouri , Arkansas , or the Indian Territory . Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States <unk> Troops of the Union Army . 
 A major supply depot was situated at the fort . Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek . The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern @-@ <unk> area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the " unstable " Indian Territory ( present @-@ day state of Oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the Five <unk> <unk> were allied with the Confederates . The fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war . Following the end of the war , in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled . 
 On January 14 , 1870 , the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas . The Post was based at Fort Scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . Some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights @-@ of @-@ way , would evict them from their <unk> homes . The settlers considered the troops <unk> to the railroads , and <unk> both as enemies . 
 Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery . By the spring of 1873 , the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good . From 1873 to 1965 , the buildings of the fort were left <unk> , and slowly deteriorated . Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use . 
 
 = = Modern times = = 
 
 With the Act of August 31 , 1965 , the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott , Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . 
 On October 19 , 1978 , Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service , encompassing 17 acres ( 69 @,@ 000 m2 ) . Today the fort is open throughout the year , save for <unk> , Christmas , and New Years Day . <unk> has declined in recent years . In 2005 visitation was 25 @,@ <unk> ; in 2007 it was 22 @,@ 314 . 
 Surviving structures include four officers ' barracks , one <unk> 's barracks , two infantry barracks , a hospital , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , ordnance and post headquarters , <unk> <unk> , <unk> shop , flagpole , and magazine . Another feature of the park is 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) of <unk> prairie restored as part of an ecology @-@ restoration project .

 Home Made <unk> Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner . The focus of the humor is in a <unk> <unk> that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more <unk> , but three people each add brandy to the <unk> . Everyone becomes <unk> upon eating the <unk> , including the family cat , and the film concludes . No cast or staff credits for this film are known . The film was released on September 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications . Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one <unk> split eight ways would be able to impact everyone . The film is presumed lost .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 . It states : " Life in a country town is often tedious and <unk> , and were it not for the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ <unk> of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . The <unk> thought well of this established feature . They made it a <unk> occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . " 
 " On the night before such an event neither <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first <unk> of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> were ever looking after the need of the said <unk> . First <unk> Gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then <unk> Gale would <unk> over and give it a stir ; finally <unk> Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then arrived the guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . While she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> Gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> . Off she speeds to a <unk> of whiskey in the kitchen . She <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then <unk> Gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored . He , too , <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> . No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . She <unk> ' the right proportion ' in , too . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced <unk> employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was <unk> in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes <unk> <unk> , <unk> D. Barnes , Frank H.

 The single reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on September 27 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . The film would also be shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre . In 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of <unk> of Moving Pictures . 
 The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . The reviewer states , " A domestic comedy with a different flavor . In fact , with a <unk> <unk> for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of <unk> , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this <unk> . What happened to the guests who <unk> of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one <unk> <unk> ! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The <unk> <unk> episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone . " Walton of The Moving Picture News was not <unk> by the plot and stated , " To me the last scene had no humor . It was only the necessary ending to the beginning . True humor does not <unk> from <unk> . " The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , " This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . Two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . The character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . "

 " Back Off <unk> " is a song by English musician <unk> Starr , released as a non @-@ album single in March 1972 . Starr 's former Beatles <unk> George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 . The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971 hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " Back Off <unk> " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 . It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom . 
 The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc <unk> . Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " Back Off <unk> " demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band T. Rex around this time . Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus <unk> . 
 Starr re @-@ recorded " Back Off <unk> " for his 1981 album Stop and <unk> the Roses , in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " . The original version has appeared on Starr 's compilation albums <unk> from Your Past and <unk> : The Very Best of <unk> Starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album <unk> Vienna . Since his return to touring in 1989 , Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " regularly in concert with the various <unk> of his All @-@ Starr Band . 
 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 
 <unk> Starr identified his initial inspiration for " Back Off <unk> " as having come from Marc <unk> , the singer and guitarist with English <unk> rock band T. Rex . In a 2001 interview with <unk> editor Paul Du <unk> , Starr described <unk> as " a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies , a big office in town , and the hang @-@ out for myself , Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon " . Over dinner one evening at Starr 's home outside London , <unk> had used the word " <unk> " so often that it stuck in Starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight . When discussing the composition on VH1 <unk> in May 1998 , Starr explained : " [ <unk> ] was an <unk> guy . He used to speak : ' Back off <unk> ... <unk> you , <unk> . ' ' Do you want some potatoes ? ' ' <unk> you , <unk> ! ' " Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song . 
 The lyrics to the middle eight of " Back Off <unk> " came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television 's football show , The Big Match . The program 's host , Jimmy Hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as " <unk> " , a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : 
 Get yourself together now 
 And give me something <unk> 
 Everything you try to do 
 You know it sure sounds wasted . 
 Commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles <unk> Paul McCartney . Starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more " , Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes . Starr had publicly criticised McCartney 's solo albums McCartney ( 1970 ) and Ram ( 1971 ) on release , and author Bruce <unk> <unk> the message of the middle eight as " a plea for Paul to produce better music " . The mention of " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to McCartney 's <unk> with cannabis , Rodriguez suggests . A further example of Starr 's allegedly anti @-@ McCartney message exists in the song 's first verse : 
 Wake up , <unk> 
 Don 't pretend that you are dead 
 Get yourself up off the cart . 
 The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 " Paul Is Dead " hoax . The latter <unk> circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm , <unk> after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a " divorce " from the Beatles . 
 In addition to these supposed messages in " Back Off <unk> " , observers have viewed the song title as Starr 's <unk> to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps , which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney 's favour . Author Keith <unk> writes that " <unk> " had " long been cited as Paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates Starr , Lennon and George Harrison . While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just happened to fit perfectly into the ' us vs. Paul ' mindset " following the Beatles ' break @-@ up , to the extent that " Back Off <unk> " was " as <unk> as ' Early 1970 ' had been <unk> " . When <unk> his 1970 composition " I 'm the Greatest " for Starr to record on the album <unk> ( 1973 ) , Lennon referenced the song title with the lines " Now I 'm only thirty @-@ two / And all I want to do is <unk> " . 
 Although " T Rex devotees " , in the words of Starr biographer Alan <unk> , claimed that <unk> had ghost @-@ written " Back Off <unk> " , Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co @-@ wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . As on Starr 's 1971 hit single " It Don 't Come Easy " , Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution . Starr originally offered " Back Off <unk> " to fellow <unk> <unk> Black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new Starr – Harrison composition , " <unk> " .

 Having earmarked the song as his next single , Starr recorded " Back Off <unk> " in September 1971 , following his appearance at the Harrison @-@ organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York . The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London , with Harrison producing , as he had on " It Don 't Come Easy " . The recording reflects the influence of <unk> rock on Starr through what authors <unk> <unk> and Mark Easter term " its big drum sound and <unk> nature " , with a line @-@ up comprising Starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , Harrison ( guitars ) , Gary Wright ( piano ) and Klaus <unk> ( bass , saxophone ) . 
 Rodriguez describes Starr 's " martial @-@ sounding opening " as a rare " showcase for his own drumming " , while Harrison biographer Simon <unk> writes of " a <unk> series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind <unk> <unk> " . Further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists , led by American soul singer Madeline Bell .

 Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R <unk> , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple 1849 . It was Starr 's first release since " It Don 't Come Easy " , a year before . During this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 <unk> ( 1971 ) and <unk> . Further <unk> himself with Britain 's <unk> rock movement , Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , a film starring <unk> that included Starr 's footage of a T.

With " Back Off <unk> " , NME critic Bob <unk> noted Starr 's success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and wrote that the single " confirmed that he and Harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and <unk> " compared with McCartney and Lennon . 
 The song was a hit in the US , reaching number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and achieved Starr 's best position on the UK Singles Chart , where it reached number 2 . A promotional video for " Back Off <unk> " was shot on 20 March at Lennon 's Tittenhurst Park residence while Starr was looking after the property . The video , which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a <unk> @-@ like monster , was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by <unk> Films . A similar monster appeared on the single 's picture sleeve , holding a cigarette . 
 Alan <unk> writes of reviewers criticising " Back Off <unk> " for being <unk> , leading Starr to respond in a 1973 interview : " Play me a pop song that isn 't . " On release , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " A Number One hit could easily be in store for the <unk> of rock drums . There 's a touch of the Marc <unk> in this highly playable rhythmic <unk> ... It 's hypnotic and effective , ideal for <unk> and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week . " <unk> described the single as " every bit as <unk> " as " It Don 't Come Easy " , although " slightly inferior " , while Mike <unk> of AllMusic views it as a song where " [ t ] he <unk> spirit of <unk> Starr shines through " . In a 1974 article for the NME , Charles <unk> Murray highlighted " Back Off <unk> " as a " great radio and <unk> @-@ box tune " .

In the 2005 publication NME <unk> : Beatles – The Solo Years 1970 – 1980 , Paul Moody listed " Back Off <unk> " first among Starr 's " ten solo gems " and described it as " Good time rock <unk> to match the Faces " . Guitar World editor Damian <unk> includes the song on his list of Harrison 's ten best post @-@ Beatles " Guitar <unk> " , saying of the recording : " the main event is clearly Harrison 's slightly wild , <unk> – and very <unk> – slide guitar solo , which includes an alternate melody line that 's even <unk> than the melody <unk> is singing .

Similar to Nilsson 's 1968 cover of the Beatles ' " You Can 't Do That " , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band 's songs – in this case , " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Help !

 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is a song by Irish rock band U2 . It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987 . The song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end . Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast . During the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the US , number fourteen in Canada , number ten in the Netherlands , and number four in the United Kingdom . The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was performed on a Los Angeles <unk> for the filming of its music video , which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video . 
 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 
 The music for " Where the Streets Have No Name " originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions . In an upstairs room at <unk> House — his newly purchased home — The Edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , The Edge wanted to " <unk> up the ultimate U2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan . After finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing guitar part and song of [ his ] life " . With no one in the house to share the demo with , The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . 
 Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . <unk> Adam Clayton said , " At the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " . The arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was <unk> many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . According to co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois , " that was the science project song . I remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> , as we call them . I was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> . It was ridiculous . " Co @-@ producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . The band worked on a single take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . Through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance . 
 So much time had been spent on " <unk> work " that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . His idea was to " stage an accident " and have the song 's tapes erased . He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . At one point , Eno had the tapes <unk> up and ready to be recorded over , but this <unk> never took place ; according to engineer Flood , fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the <unk> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno . 
 The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes . It was one of several songs mixed by Steve <unk> in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree . Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. later said of the song , " It took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it . It only became a truly great song through playing live . On the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live . " 
 
 = = Composition = = 
 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute . The introduction and <unk> are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature . The songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes . The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " <unk> " six @-@ note <unk> . A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the <unk> twice , thus creating a rich sound . The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 . 
 The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – vi – V – I chord progression , creates a " wall of sound " , as described by Mark Butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming <unk> sixteenth notes . The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its <unk> , ( " he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> <unk> ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage of <unk> to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat . 
 This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( A – G – F ♯ – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the <unk> at " burning " . In later choruses , Bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . After the third chorus , the song 's <unk> is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @-@ note guitar <unk> played against sustained <unk> notes . 
 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 
 The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast , Northern Ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on . He contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting Ethiopia , saying : " ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . To me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... Maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . " Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife , Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an <unk> bag while staying in a village . 
 According to him , the song is ostensibly about " <unk> , elevation , whatever you want to call it . " Bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to " sketches " , said that " ' Where the Streets Have No Name ' is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the LP , because it 's a sketch — I was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . I was trying to sketch a feeling . " 
 The open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send " a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that . I used to think it was Belfast ... " Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono 's and his wife Ali 's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers . Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics : " I can look at it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one of the most <unk> couplets in the history of pop music . But it also contains some of the biggest ideas . In a curious way , that seems to work . If you get any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate . But if you 're flip or <unk> about it , then you do . That 's one of the <unk> I 've come to terms with . "

Police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance . Two minutes into the video , U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th <unk> and S. Main St. , and perform " Where the Streets Have No Name " to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building . Towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police . 
 The video for " Where the Streets Have No Name " was directed by <unk> Avis and produced by Michael <unk> and Ben <unk> . The band attracted over 1 @,@ 000 people during the video 's filming , which took place on the <unk> of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987 . The band 's performance on a <unk> in a public place was a reference to The Beatles ' final concert , as depicted in the film Let It Be . 
 During the shoot U2 played an eight @-@ song set , which included four performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be <unk> by a group of fans . A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming . 
 The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video . <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . According to Avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in real time " , and that " getting <unk> was an integral part of the plan . " Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to <unk> the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video . In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot . Although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version of the song . The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards .

 " Race Against Time " was released on the 12 @-@ inch , cassette , and CD versions of the single . The song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by The Edge as " a kind of Afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a study in rhythm . " The bass riff in the song , inspired by the <unk> , was played by The Edge , but stemmed from some of Clayton 's unused bass parts . Mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take . The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono 's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " Race against time " . Bono said of the song , " It reminds me of the desert . The desert is so empty , but it <unk> with a strange kind of <unk> . " John Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an " African flavour " and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel . The track was used in the Miami Vice episode " Child 's Play " , and is the only one of the single 's B @-@ sides that was never played live . 
 " Silver and Gold " was written in support of the Artists United Against <unk> project , which protested the South African apartheid . In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van <unk> 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones . When Richards and Jagger played blues , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . This inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have No Name " single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was described by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in <unk> and confident voice , <unk> by a <unk> bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar . " " Silver and Gold " was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and <unk> , Rattle and Hum . Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree . The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 . 
 " <unk> Thing " was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday . The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play . Some of Bono 's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of John Lennon . The Edge described it as " a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " , also noting that " It 's very new for us . " It was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for The Best of 1980 – 1990 . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track , along with " Race Against Time " , is " an indicator of what U2 might have made instead of The Joshua Tree . "

 Upon the release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Steve <unk> of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @-@ like tones from the Edge <unk> [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " . The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest . Rolling Stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of The Joshua Tree . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said of " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " . The Washington Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in Bono 's resolute delivery , Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's <unk> guitar , Adam Clayton 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " . 
 NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album " starts by spitting furiously " . The publication praised Bono 's impassioned singing and The Edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into " something more than an <unk> abused piece of wood " . The review commented that the " last ten seconds are <unk> beautiful " . The Rocket wrote that the song builds a " wall of sound " that Bono 's vocals cut through with a " <unk> of <unk> , as the lyrics <unk> the need for personal spirituality " . The reviewer compared the opening riff to <unk> <unk> ' " <unk> " . Reviewing The Joshua Tree , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an " epic opener " . The service 's Steve Huey , in a review of the song , praised its " <unk> , propulsive rhythmic drive and <unk> chorus " , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite . He called the song the " perfect album @-@ opener " , <unk> the " slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak " . Huey also called Bono 's delivery " passionate and grandiose " and " his commitment to the material <unk> " . He believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's " sonic power " is what gave U2 its " tremendous force " .

 " Where the Streets Have No Name " made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 in <unk> , Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour . It has since been played at nearly every full @-@ length concert that U2 has <unk> , totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 . The song is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs . Bono said of it , " We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes . The audience is on its feet , singing along with every word . It 's like God suddenly walks through the room . " 
 On The Joshua Tree Tour , " Where the Streets Have No Name " was most often used to open concerts . Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that , " From the <unk> sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , <unk> and <unk> . " NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where " the power afforded their songs is scary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena <unk> " . In other reviews , the song was called : " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " powerful " . Out of the 109 shows during The Joshua Tree Tour , " Streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts . During the <unk> Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " Streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts . 
 The song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour . Concerts from this tour were elaborate <unk> <unk> that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " Where the Streets Have No Name " , straight . Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree 's photo shoot . The video was <unk> up for humorous effect — NME described the effect as giving it a " silly , Charlie <unk> quality " — and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens . This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour . Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can 't Take My Eyes off You ) " ) . Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys ' cover . Critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : The Independent said the song " <unk> instant euphoria , as U2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " . In two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits . 
 For the PopMart Tour of 1997 – 1998 , U2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour . The set 's massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an " astonishing , 2001 @-@ style trip into the heart of a <unk> , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal <unk> " . Near the end of the song , peace <unk> were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards . Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a " UFO landing site " . 
 Shortly before the third leg of the <unk> Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band 's first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of <unk> Lights " . The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl <unk> halftime show on 3 February 2002 . The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . U2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super Bowl <unk> <unk> " . 
 For the Vertigo Tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their <unk> , but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this . All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's LED video <unk> displaying African flags . On the tour 's opening night , this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village . He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , " And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the stuff about <unk> lands and <unk> making sense for the first time . " The song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival . At the Glastonbury Festival 2010 , The Edge accompanied rock band <unk> for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011 . 
 Live performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum , Zoo TV : Live from Sydney , and PopMart : Live from Mexico City , as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts , Zoo TV Live and Hasta la Vista Baby ! U2 Live from Mexico City . A second version from the PopMart Tour was featured on Please : <unk> Live EP , and later on the U.S. " Please " single . A live recording from Boston during the <unk> Tour was featured in the concert film <unk> 2001 : Live from Boston , and on the " Walk On " and " Electrical Storm " singles . The concert video and album U2 Go Home : Live from <unk> Castle , Ireland featured another performance from the <unk> Tour , and later performances were featured in the concert films Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago and U2 3D ( Vertigo Tour ) , and U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl ( U2 360 ° Tour ) . The 2004 digital album , Live from the Point Depot , contains a performance from the <unk> Tour , only available as part of The Complete U2 digital box set .

 In 2002 , Q magazine named " Where the Streets Have No Name " the <unk> " most exciting tune ever " . The following year , Q ranked the song at number <unk> in a special edition titled " <unk> Best Songs Ever " . Three years later , the magazine 's readers voted the track the 43rd @-@ greatest song in history . Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 28 on its list of the " 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time . " In a 2010 poll by fan site <unk> U2 , approximately 29 % of 4 @,@ 800 <unk> named " Where the Streets Have No Name " as their favourite song from The Joshua Tree , ranking it as the most popular song from the album . In 2010 , American sports network ESPN used the track , among other U2 songs , in commercials for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , with the South African <unk> Gospel Choir adding vocals to the song . The advertisement , titled " <unk> Island " , portrays South African political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team . There are plans to bring a recording of the <unk> @-@ supported performance to retail . Composer John <unk> used the introductory guitar theme in his 2009 piece for wind ensemble , Aurora <unk> . The song 's introduction was used by the Vancouver Canucks hockey team at the start each of their home games , when the players take to the ice . The Baltimore <unk> also use the song as they enter M & T Bank Stadium before home games . The Marquette Golden Eagles men 's basketball team uses this song in their entrance video before all home games at the <unk> Harris Bradley Center . The song is also used by the Wisconsin <unk> football team for their entrance video at Camp Randall Stadium prior to all home games . The Kansas <unk> men 's basketball team uses the song during their starting <unk> at Allen <unk> .

 = <unk> <unk> reaction = 
 
 The <unk> <unk> reaction ( often referred to as simply the <unk> <unk> ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of <unk> . The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . It was originally discovered by Ivan <unk> <unk> ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> . 
 As originally described , the <unk> <unk> involves the activation of a <unk> <unk> using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or <unk> acid promoter . The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ring closure which forms the <unk> product ( See <unk> below ) . As the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than <unk> <unk> and <unk> other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name <unk> <unk> provided that they follow a similar <unk> pathway . 
 The success of the <unk> <unk> as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and <unk> of <unk> as both motifs in natural products ( including <unk> , the <unk> , and a <unk> of <unk> ) and as useful synthetic <unk> for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The mechanism of the classical <unk> <unk> reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by <unk> to be an <unk> <unk> and is outlined below . <unk> of the <unk> by the acid catalyst generates a <unk> cation which undergoes a <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> as dictated by the Woodward @-@ Hoffman rules . This generates an <unk> cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen . Subsequent <unk> of the <unk> produces the <unk> product . 
 As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what <unk> a <unk> <unk> in particular is the generation of the <unk> cation followed by <unk> ring closure to an <unk> cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The <unk> of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the <unk> <unk> due to <unk> strain . <unk> of an electron <unk> α @-@ <unk> by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . 
 Similarly , β @-@ substitution directed inward <unk> the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that E @-@ Z <unk> has been shown to occur in advance of <unk> on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans <unk> regardless of initial configuration . In this way , the <unk> <unk> is a rare example of a <unk> <unk> reaction , whereas most <unk> are <unk> . The example below uses <unk> hydride to trap the <unk> cation so that no elimination occurs . ( See <unk> <unk> below ) 
 Along this same vein , <unk> vinyl <unk> of the type studied extensively by Marcus <unk> of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β @-@ <unk> , <unk> a large amount of <unk> strain in the s @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = Classical <unk> <unk> = = 
 
 Though <unk> following the general template above had been observed prior to <unk> 's involvement , it was his study of the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> that marked the first major examination of this process . <unk> correctly reasoned that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in situ to form a <unk> <unk> before ring closure to the <unk> product . The reaction shown below involves an <unk> <unk> reaction to generate the <unk> <unk> . 
 Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several syntheses employing the <unk> <unk> were published . <unk> below are key steps in the syntheses of <unk> and Nor @-@ <unk> , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that generates the <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 The classical version of the <unk> <unk> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to <unk> . The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to <unk> ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <unk> of the intermediate . 
 Strong Lewis or <unk> acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . These <unk> are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . 
 Despite the <unk> possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . This limits the atom economy of the reaction . 
 The elimination step is not <unk> ; if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is typically required . 
 <unk> destroys a potential <unk> , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction . 
 <unk> of the <unk> is sometimes not <unk> , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of <unk> . 
 
 = = Modern variants = = 
 
 The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the <unk> <unk> reaction in its canonical form . However , modifications to the reaction focused on <unk> its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve functional group tolerance , directing the <unk> of the elimination step , and improving the overall <unk> . These have been successful to varying degrees . 
 Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the <unk> cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation " intercepted " in various ways . Furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below . 
 
 = = = <unk> @-@ directed <unk> = = = 
 
 The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the <unk> <unk> took advantage of the β @-@ silicon effect in order to direct the <unk> of the elimination step . This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois , <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron <unk> to promote the reaction . With <unk> products , the <unk> <unk> was selected for to varying degrees . 
 The silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product <unk> , shown below . The <unk> takes place before elimination of the <unk> alcohol <unk> , so that the resulting <unk> of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 Drawing on the <unk> effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for " polarized " <unk> <unk> in which electron <unk> and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction . Creation of an effective vinyl <unk> and vinyl <unk> in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper <unk> and <unk> elimination . In addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the <unk> of the α @-@ proton , allowing selective formation of the trans @-@ α @-@ <unk> via <unk> . 
 It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a <unk> or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower . 
 
 = = = Alternative cation generation = = = 
 
 By extension , any <unk> cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a <unk> <unk> . There have been a large number of examples published where the <unk> cation is arrived at by a variety of <unk> . One such example involves the silver <unk> <unk> ring opening of <unk> <unk> <unk> . The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of <unk> silver chloride . 
 In the total synthesis of <unk> , <unk> of a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise generates a <unk> cation via ring opening of the resultant <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 Once the <unk> has occurred , an <unk> cation is formed . As discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by <unk> <unk> . However , these two steps can be interrupted by various <unk> and <unk> , respectively . <unk> cation trapping has been developed extensively by <unk> G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field . The <unk> cation can be trapped with <unk> and carbon <unk> and can also undergo <unk> <unk> with various <unk> partners . <unk> below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a <unk> core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity . 
 <unk> trapping with various <unk> is <unk> less common . In one study , the <unk> <unk> is paired with a Michael reaction using an <unk> catalyst to initiate nucleophilic <unk> addition of the <unk> to β @-@ <unk> . In this tandem reaction the <unk> catalyst is required for both <unk> : it acts as the Lewis acid in the <unk> <unk> and in the next step the <unk> group of <unk> first coordinates to <unk> in a ligand exchange with the <unk> <unk> oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R @-@ group . 
 
 = = = <unk> variants = = = 
 
 The development of an enantioselective <unk> <unk> is a desirable addition to the repertoire of <unk> <unk> reactions . To that end , several variations have been developed utilizing <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> are also known , in which extant <unk> direct the <unk> . Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of <unk> ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to " <unk> " in turn sets the <unk> as shown below . 
 <unk> @-@ directed <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . In the example below , the <unk> @-@ group acts to direct the <unk> by preventing the distant <unk> from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable <unk> interaction . In this way the silicon acts as a <unk> auxiliary . ( The starting material is not <unk> but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the <unk> . ) 
 <unk> 's <unk> substrates can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used . The example below generates a <unk> <unk> in 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess . 
 <unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for <unk> <unk> that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of <unk> . The key step employs an unusual mixture of <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent . 
 The first <unk> Lewis acid promoted asymmetric <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) <unk> ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 <unk> % of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .

 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are generally also subsumed under the same name . For example , an α @-@ β , γ @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> can undergo a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> that is typically referred to as an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reaction . Other such extensions have been given similar names , including <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .

 Because they <unk> the <unk> cation , β @-@ electron <unk> <unk> often severely impede <unk> <unk> . Building from this , several <unk> ring openings of β @-@ <unk> <unk> have been reported . These are typically referred to as retro @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions .

 <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> reaction ( known as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions ) have few instances ; there is one example of a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reported ( shown below ) , and several <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> reactions in the literature . Even these tend to suffer from poor <unk> , poor yields , or narrow scope . The difficulty stems from the relative over @-@ stabilization of the <unk> cation by electron donation , <unk> <unk> .

 <unk> <unk> is a 2011 American black comedy film directed by Seth Gordon , written by Michael <unk> , John Francis <unk> and Jonathan Goldstein , based on a story by <unk> . It stars Jason Bateman , Charlie Day , Jason Sudeikis , Jennifer Aniston , Colin Farrell , Kevin Spacey , and Jamie <unk> . The plot follows three friends , played by Bateman , Day , and Sudeikis , who decide to murder their respective overbearing , abusive bosses , portrayed by Spacey , Aniston and Farrell . 
 <unk> 's script was bought by New Line Cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre @-@ production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles . By 2010 , Goldstein and <unk> had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production . 
 The film premiered in Los Angeles on June 30 , 2011 , and received a wide release on July 8 , 2011 . The film exceeded financial expectations , <unk> over $ 28 million in the first three days , making it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend , and going on to become the highest @-@ grossing black comedy film of all time in <unk> dollars , breaking the record previously set by The War of the Roses in 1990 . The film grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide during its theatrical run . 
 The film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews . The plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , <unk> , and <unk> . A sequel , <unk> <unk> 2 , was released on November 26 , 2014 .

The <unk> close , the door locks and you think , ' It 's the Temple of Doom . ' " Similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street " which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn 't get away with at work . "

" <unk> continued , " It features a <unk> of anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an ' 80s Studio 54 vibe , a makeshift <unk> , lots of mirrors and a <unk> table . " Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon 's interpretation of the character and his " infatuation " with martial arts and " his <unk> of prowess " .

" " <unk> " was represented by an office building in <unk> , California , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . For " <unk> Chemical " , the production team found a " perfect landscape of pipes and containers " in Santa Fe Springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility .

To achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on two @-@ inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . He explained , " The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . It isn 't over @-@ produced or <unk> and digital in any way . It 's <unk> , noisy , and full of <unk> and <unk> . I knew that if we could <unk> some of this sonic magic in the score , then the <unk> and confidence of the music would play against Bateman , Sudeikis , and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that <unk> . " <unk> continued , " We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection . We even used the same <unk> that Money Mark played on Beck 's classic ‘ Where It 's At ’ . At the end of the day , Seth [ Gordon ] and I wanted to produce a score that is as <unk> and full of attitude as the movie itself . I think we did it ... and most of all , everyone had a blast in the process . "

 The conspirators included : Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> @-@ Anne <unk> , Chief Financial Officer of <unk> ; Susan <unk> , head of security at <unk> , Catherine Jane <unk> , who bought weapons and <unk> and volunteered to be the actual murderer ; Ann <unk> McCarthy , fourth @-@ in @-@ command of <unk> ; and co @-@ conspirators Alma Potter , Carol Matthews , <unk> Caldwell and Richard Kevin <unk> .

The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later , as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the <unk> attack in The <unk> and other illegal acts by the <unk> leadership . 
 Prosecution of the conspirators began in 1990 , when a federal grand jury brought <unk> against several of the key players . Some had fled the country , and <unk> proceedings against the <unk> and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years . The final <unk> was convicted in 2006 , when Catherine Jane <unk> agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia .

 Seven followers ( called <unk> ) of charismatic leader <unk> <unk> <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) , were convicted of a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner , and an additional <unk> eighth member of the <unk> commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy . The <unk> were high @-@ ranking followers within the <unk> organization . <unk> in the case stated that the <unk> had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group 's activities in <unk> , Oregon .

" Jesus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the <unk> commune resided , except for <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Ma Anand <unk> and three other <unk> followers traveled to New York in the spring of 1985 to acquire false identification . According to a federal <unk> , the <unk> of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns . Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase <unk> . Caldwell stated she and Catherine Jane <unk> flew to Texas to purchase guns there . They purchased five guns in Texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing <unk> in Texas with out @-@ of @-@ state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead . Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed " not to come back without the guns " . 
 In New Mexico , they obtained false identification , and purchased several pistols . Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace . Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico : " we found it was pretty easy to buy guns . All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get . " Caldwell said she and <unk> went to a university library to find the identity " of someone dying very young " , next went " to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate " and described how " we got a rent <unk> book and just made up a rent <unk> " . " And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in <unk> with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets , " said Caldwell . They were able to obtain one <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber revolver , and four <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber Security @-@ Six Magnum <unk> .

 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . <unk> follower Carol Matthews ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college <unk> of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court records state that Matthews and an <unk> co @-@ <unk> gave <unk> registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting " a <unk> survey on President Reagan 's economic plan " , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officials did not give them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said " Turner " .

Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry <unk> Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an <unk> given to the FBI , <unk> Alma <unk> described how the <unk> decided on the federal parking garage as the location : " <unk> <unk> [ Catherine Jane <unk> ] said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off .

According to The <unk> the <unk> were not carried out because Ma Anand <unk> became distracted by political power plays within the <unk> commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group .

It earned $ 432 million worldwide , becoming the sixth highest grossing film of 2002 . 
 Die Another Day became a controversial subject in eastern Asia . The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war @-@ hungry . The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002 , as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland , and by a <unk> scene near a statue of the Buddha . The <unk> Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was " <unk> to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics " . The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States . An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was " the wrong film at the wrong time . " 
 The amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism , specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC , Time and Reuters who all used the pun " Buy Another Day " . Reportedly 20 companies , paying $ 70 million , had their products featured in the film , a record at the time , although USA Today reported that number to be as high as $ 100 million .

 Rotten Tomatoes listed Die Another Day with a 58 % rating . Metacritic gave the film a 56 out of 100 rating , representing " mixed or average reviews . " Michael <unk> of Film <unk> praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce <unk> and " the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory . " Larry Carroll of <unk> praised Lee <unk> for having " <unk> balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend , makes reference to the classic films that preceded it , but also <unk> a new <unk> to it all . " Entertainment Weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction , saying that <unk> , " a true filmmaker " , has re @-@ established the series ' pop <unk> . Dana Stevens of The New York Times called the film the best of the James Bond series since The Spy Who Loved Me . Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the " first half of Die Another Day is classic Bond " , but that " Things start to go <unk> when the ice palace gets introduced . " 
 However , Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on <unk> and special effects , with the plot being neglected . James <unk> of <unk> said , " This is a train wreck of an action film – a <unk> attempt by the filmmakers to force @-@ feed James Bond into the mindless <unk> mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud <unk> . " Of the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and <unk> bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture . Coupled with <unk> production design , Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap . Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non @-@ stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string . " Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first Bond in space ! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage ? Please ! "

 Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then @-@ current official James Bond writer , Raymond Benson , based on the screenplay by Neal <unk> and Robert Wade . Fan reaction to it was above average .

She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie <unk> . After a series of three meetings , a year after the birth of her first child , she agreed to assume the role of <unk> , despite being " nervous about signing such a long contract " , stating : " I 've been someone who 's loved the uncertainty of acting . I 've loved that one month it 's <unk> in Morocco and the next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six @-@ part <unk> thing . But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks . It would be nice just to stay put for a while . If I 'm going to be a working mum I 'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently . And then <unk> came along , so I 'm very grateful " . 
 <unk> signed a three @-@ year contract to play <unk> , and described herself as " very similar " to her character , speaking positively about her working relationship with co @-@ stars Jaye <unk> and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the " dream " storylines her character was given . She said of the show : 
 " I really love <unk> and I 'm surprised how much . What thrills me about <unk> is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . That 's actually a lot of fun . What 's great is nobody says , ' Just shut up . ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think , ' do I want to do something else ? ' but I really like this job , I never get that awful ‘ <unk> ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work . " 
 In October 2008 , <unk> announced that she would be departing from <unk> City in order to have a second child , stating : " I 've had a great time and I 'll miss it .

She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem , explaining that : " I get offered a lot of very different roles , but they 're never Welsh .

She presented the film at the Cannes film festival , using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre , films and television . The project , however , was largely unsuccessful , with <unk> stating : " it just made me decide that if there 's anything I don 't want to do , it 's produce films , because I 'm rubbish at it . I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end .

 = Du Fu = 
 
 Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : <unk> ; <unk> – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li <unk> ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An <unk> Rebellion of <unk> , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
 Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the " Poet @-@ Historian " and the " Poet @-@ Sage " by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , <unk> , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , <unk> , <unk> , Hugo or <unk> " . 
 
 = = Life = = 
 
 Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William <unk> , is that Chinese poems are typically <unk> , <unk> context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to understand it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the " <unk> " <unk> used for more limited poets . 
 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 
 Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du <unk> , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in <unk> ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family . 
 Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother . 
 The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and <unk> of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens , but these have been lost . 
 In the early <unk> , he travelled in the <unk> / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . <unk> concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to <unk> connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei . 
 His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs . 
 In the autumn of <unk> , he met Li <unk> ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li <unk> was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li <unk> from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in <unk> . 
 In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead <unk> the emperor directly in <unk> , 754 and probably again in <unk> . He married around <unk> , and by <unk> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in <unk> . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of <unk> which <unk> him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . 
 In <unk> , he received an appointment as <unk> of the Right Commandant 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events . 
 
 = = = War = = = 
 
 The An <unk> Rebellion began in December <unk> , and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars , associated <unk> and imperial <unk> . This period of <unk> was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own <unk> . Du Fu wrote : 
 <unk> on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be <unk> by the winds . 
 In <unk> , Emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and <unk> . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( <unk> ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du <unk> ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria . 
 He escaped from Chang 'an the following year , and was appointed <unk> when he rejoined the court in May <unk> . This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but was <unk> in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , <unk> , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be <unk> , and in the summer of <unk> he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in <unk> . The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote : 
 I am about to scream <unk> in the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk . 
 He moved on in the summer of <unk> ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but <unk> believes that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in <unk> ( now <unk> , Gansu province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 In December <unk> , he briefly stayed in <unk> ( modern Gansu ) . He departed on December 24 for <unk> ( Sichuan province ) , where he was hosted by local <unk> and fellow poet <unk> Di . Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poems <unk> help to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at <unk> . Despite his financial problems , this was one of the <unk> and most peaceful periods of his life . Many of Du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at " <unk> <unk> " . In 762 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summer <unk> when he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against the <unk> Empire . 
 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 
 Luoyang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , and in the spring of <unk> Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , <unk> and general old age in addition to his previous <unk> ) . They stayed in <unk> ( in what is now <unk> , <unk> ) at the entrance to the Three <unk> for almost two years from late spring <unk> . This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn <unk> , Bo <unk> became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary . 
 In March <unk> , he began his journey again and got as far as <unk> province , where he died in <unk> ( now <unk> ) in November or December 770 , in his <unk> year . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan <unk> in <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be a <unk> son , an affectionate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , a <unk> official , and a patriotic subject . " 
 Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , To My <unk> Friend <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces :

 Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the " poet historian " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . <unk> , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " . 
 Du Fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : his <unk> have been <unk> as , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history . 
 
 = = = <unk> engagement = = = 
 
 A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , <unk> . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the <unk> ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the <unk> of a <unk> soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life . 
 Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming <unk> , Hawkes argues that his " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> " . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " . 
 Du Fu 's compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , " everything in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems . 
 
 = = = Technical excellence = = = 
 
 Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term <unk> ( <unk> " complete <unk> " ) , a reference to <unk> ' description of <unk> . Yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing in <unk> that his predecessor , " united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly " . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he " either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and <unk> to the <unk> and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is <unk> even within individual works : Owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shifts " in poems which enable the poet to represent different <unk> of a situation , while Chou uses the term " juxtaposition " as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on <unk> and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han <unk> <unk> a controversy that has persisted to the present day . 
 The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( " <unk> @-@ like " according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the " <unk> simplicity " of the <unk> poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his <unk> period are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the late <unk> period have a " density and power of vision " . 
 Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his <unk> , a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example : 
 About two thirds of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner " .

 According to the <unk> Britannica , Du Fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all the <unk> overtones of a phrase and of all the <unk> <unk> of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . " 
 In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry . 
 However , as <unk> notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from <unk> <unk> , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li <unk> on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , <unk> <unk> constructed the first replica of his <unk> cottage in Sichuan . 
 It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang <unk> , Li <unk> and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , <unk> and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ <unk> ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic <unk> , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was " <unk> ... because ... through all his <unk> , he never for the space of a meal <unk> his sovereign " . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary <unk> could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people 's language " . 
 Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : <unk> <unk> 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> on the <unk> are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the <unk> from mere word play into " a vehicle for serious poetic <unk> " set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
 In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth <unk> , who has described him as " the greatest non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a <unk> organism " . 
 
 = = = Influence on Japanese literature = = = 
 
 Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the <unk> period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including <unk> <unk> , the very greatest of all <unk> poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu . 
 Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred <unk> <unk> above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some <unk> ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) anthologies such as <unk> <unk> in the 9th century . The first notable Japanese <unk> of Du Fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) , a <unk> <unk> patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a <unk> priest in Vol . 11 of <unk> . His student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their <unk> . <unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the Court and <unk> <unk> and <unk> Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day <unk> <unk> , the <unk> regent of the Court and the highest authority of <unk> poetry , asked <unk> , " Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li <unk> ? " <unk> <unk> to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been many <unk> on Du Fu 's poetry both in <unk> temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the <unk> period , e.g. , <unk> , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some <unk> plays such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 During the Kan <unk> era of the Edo period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) of the Ming Dynasty 's <unk> <unk> on Du Fu 's <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and <unk> ( <unk> ) class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , <unk> <unk> , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of <unk> <unk> that <unk> [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too <unk> . <unk> <unk> , the greatest <unk> poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in <unk> no <unk> , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View ( <unk> ) before a <unk> as its introduction and also many of his other <unk> have similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around .

 A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , " There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible " ( <unk> <unk> ) . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding <unk> to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or <unk> ) , and <unk> the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that " his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation " — <unk> <unk> ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth <unk> 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to <unk> most of these poems from his selection , and <unk> to " translate out " the references in those works which he does select . 
 Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith <unk> in Facing the Moon <unk> the Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of <unk> . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the <unk> quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk> . 
 In 2015 , Stephen Owen published translations , with facing Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized <unk> .

 The <unk> @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) during World War I. Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding <unk> class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great <unk> earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War . 
 Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of <unk> . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape <unk> in late 1944 , where they <unk> the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of <unk> away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation <unk> , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 .

 The design of the <unk> @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The <unk> 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of <unk> . 
 In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . <unk> <unk> , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , <unk> theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ <unk> t ) each . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships . 
 The launch of HMS <unk> in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans . <unk> 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , <unk> rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new <unk> @-@ class battleships and two <unk> @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were <unk> by their British counterparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was <unk> . 
 The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the <unk> class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the <unk> class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more <unk> @-@ class ships ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . While <unk> was laid down later that year , the <unk> lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of <unk> and <unk> until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 . 
 
 = = Design and description = = 
 
 The progress of <unk> 's construction , while the <unk> waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> @-@ class design . The distribution of the <unk> gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the <unk> magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the <unk> class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the <unk> designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower <unk> gun turret was lower than in the <unk> class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian <unk> <unk> believed that these ships had the worst <unk> of any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A @-@ 92 by the <unk> and differed enough from the A @-@ 64 design of the <unk> class that it was considered a separate class . 
 The ships had a length of 208 @.@ 18 metres ( <unk> ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 28 @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load . They displaced 36 @,@ 500 long tons ( 37 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load , roughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than the preceding class . Their crew consisted of 1 @,@ 360 officers and enlisted men . They had a <unk> height of 1 @.@ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @.@ 4 in ) at deep load . 
 During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward <unk> were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <unk> . Both ships were also given torpedo <unk> to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In addition , their <unk> were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes increased their overall length to 213 @.@ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @.@ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 in ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 in ) . Their displacement increased over 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) to 42 @,@ 001 long tons ( 42 @,@ <unk> t ) at deep load . The crew now numbered 1 @,@ <unk> officers and enlisted men .

The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40 @,@ 000 or 45 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 or 34 @,@ 000 kW ) ( <unk> and <unk> respectively ) , using steam provided by 24 <unk> <unk> <unk> water @-@ tube boilers at working pressures of 13 – 16 @.@ 9 kg / <unk> ( 1 @,@ 275 – 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> ; 185 – 240 <unk> ) .

Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity of 4 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 4 @,@ <unk> t ) of coal and 1 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 9 @,@ 680 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 930 km ; 11 @,@ 140 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . <unk> and <unk> had three generators of 150 <unk> ( 200 hp ) capacity and two 250 @-@ <unk> ( 340 hp ) <unk> generators at 225 volts . 
 During their 1930s modernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new <unk> oil @-@ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed .

The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 113 long tons ( 5 @,@ 195 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 @,@ <unk> nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 580 km ; 9 @,@ 060 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .

The <unk> powered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between <unk> and + 20 degrees . In 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @-@ 1930s modernization , except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . The <unk> mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a <unk> system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armour @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed <unk> @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 775 metres per second ( 2 @,@ <unk> – 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 25 @,@ 000 metres ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ <unk> Type 3 . Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields . They had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @-@ calibre 3rd Year Type 8 @-@ <unk> AA guns in single mounts . The 7 @.@ 62 @-@ <unk> ( 3 in ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) <unk> with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @.@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . They carried twelve to eighteen 6th Year Type torpedoes which had a 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) warhead . They had three settings for range and speed : 15 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) at 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 metres ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . 
 In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted on both sides of the forward <unk> in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers two @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . The pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time . 
 During the mid @-@ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ built <unk> 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin @-@ gun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark <unk> , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees .

 The <unk> @-@ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of <unk> mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a <unk> of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armour . The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower <unk> of the belt armour . The ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm ( 10 in ) on the face and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick and that of the barbettes was <unk> mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick . 
 The <unk> class were the only Japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the <unk> wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo <unk> . The danger from <unk> shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland <unk> demonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbettes and magazines . Additionally , the vessels contained 660 <unk> compartments to preserve <unk> in the event of battle damage . In addition to the torpedo <unk> added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm . Inside the original skin of the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres ( 6 in ) of armour . 
 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 
 While the details of the ship 's fire @-@ control instruments are not fully available , it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire @-@ control director after completion . No computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually . <unk> 2 , 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6 @-@ metre ( 19 ft 8 in ) <unk> & <unk> rangefinders . These were felt to be inferior to the British <unk> & Stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres ( 19 ft 8 in or 26 ft 3 in ) length . In the late 1920s the fire @-@ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 12 @.@ 7 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , in the early 1930s . The fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @-@ 1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time . Type 21 air @-@ search <unk> were installed aboard the sisters in mid @-@ 1942 .

 <unk> was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @-@ off platform for a <unk> <unk> fighter on <unk> No. 2 in 1927 . It was replaced by a platform on <unk> No. 5 for a <unk> <unk> reconnaissance <unk> in 1928 – 29 . A catapult and a <unk> 4 @-@ <unk> ( 3 @.@ 9 @-@ long @-@ ton ) crane were fitted on the stern during the mid @-@ 1930s modernization , and the ships were equipped to operate three <unk> , although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima <unk> <unk> were replaced by Nakajima <unk> <unk> in 1938 .

 The sinking of the British capital ships Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese land @-@ based aircraft on 10 December 1941 led the <unk> to realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of the <unk> to provide any air cover and <unk> were sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway . Plans for more elaborate <unk> were rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and the <unk> settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two <unk> to launch <unk> . The <unk> @-@ class ships were selected for the conversion because <unk> had suffered an explosion in <unk> No. 5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and their <unk> No. 6 could not elevate to the full + 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long @-@ range engagement anticipated by the <unk> . The <unk> were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .

 The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and for <unk> No. 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warning <unk> were added . In September six 30 @-@ round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck . 
 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 
 A 70 @-@ metre @-@ long ( <unk> ft 8 in ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 in ) wide at its forward end and 13 metres ( 42 ft 8 in ) at the stern . It <unk> the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) . A pair of rotating gunpowder @-@ propelled <unk> were fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets . They could launch aircraft up to 4 @,@ 600 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 100 lb ) in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the <unk> and the <unk> operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the <unk> about . Two aircraft were intended to be <unk> on the <unk> and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen . 
 The 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 131 ft 3 in ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 in ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 in ) at the rear . It was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 in ) high and designed to <unk> nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting <unk> and carbon dioxide <unk> as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' <unk> lift was 12 @.@ 1 metres ( 39 ft 8 in ) wide at its forward end and 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 in ) wide at the its aft end . It was 12 @.@ 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 9 long tons ) . <unk> storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed in the former magazine of <unk> No. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft the <unk> crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted . 
 The ships had an air group of 11 each of <unk> <unk> dive bombers ( Allied reporting name " Judy " ) and <unk> <unk> reconnaissance aircraft ( Allied reporting name " Paul " ) Both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft . Coupled with a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat .

 After the loss of the fast battleship <unk> at the Naval Battle of <unk> in late 1942 to rudder damage , the <unk> decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ; 10 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots . A pair of Type 22 surface @-@ search <unk> were also fitted during the conversion . 
 The removal of the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and the <unk> height increased <unk> metres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) to 2 @.@ 81 metres ( 9 ft 3 in ) at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) to 40 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 39 @,@ 805 long tons ) . This also reduced the draught to 9 @.@ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) and the beam was slightly reduced to 31 @.@ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 in ) .

 Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . <unk> had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner , losing two crewmen . Before the start of the Pacific War , both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the Soviet Union , Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters . <unk> hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp Lieutenant Louis <unk> in 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . In Korea Bay when the 1923 Great <unk> earthquake struck , they sailed to <unk> where they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 September . Together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers , <unk> sank the destroyer <unk> in 1926 during gunnery practice . <unk> 's AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and <unk> 's two years later . The latter ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 and <unk> in 1935 – 37 , both at <unk> Naval Arsenal . During the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , the sisters frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by Japan . In August 1937 <unk> ferried two battalions of Special Naval Landing Forces to Port Arthur . Three years later , she served as the flagship for the Emperor of the puppet state of <unk> , Henry <unk> @-@ <unk> , during his state visit to Japan in June 1940 . On 15 November the ships were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . The sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external <unk> <unk> and additional AA directors .

 When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the <unk> Islands with four other battleships and the light carrier <unk> as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 11 March 1942 <unk> and <unk> sortied from their anchorage at <unk> to join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier force that had attacked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but did not catch the American carriers that had launched the <unk> Raid on 18 April . 
 During gunnery training on 5 May , there was a premature detonation in the left gun of <unk> 's <unk> No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen . Both aft magazines were flooded to <unk> the resulting fire and save the ship . She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned . On 11 May a valve in <unk> 's No. 2 engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room . While under repair at <unk> , both ships received prototype Type 21 <unk> . <unk> by Vice @-@ Admiral <unk> <unk> , the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the <unk> Support Group on 28 May , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island ( Operation <unk> ) . 
 They returned home on 14 June and the <unk> began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . The sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 July in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actual <unk> began . <unk> was converted at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 and <unk> at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November . 
 After completing her sea trials , <unk> was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at <unk> and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at <unk> in October . In November the ship began working up , joined by the newly completed <unk> the following month , and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division . On 1 May 1944 , the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral <unk> <unk> 's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet . The division 's <unk> Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June .

 <unk> of aircraft and <unk> problems greatly <unk> pilot training and the ships only had a total of 17 <unk> and 18 <unk> on hand on 1 October ; of these , only 6 and 16 were operational , respectively . The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land @-@ based aircraft and the transports by the rest of the <unk> . The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral <unk> Ozawa and the sisters sailed from <unk> on 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles ( 320 km ) east of Cape <unk> , the northeastern tip of Luzon . The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an <unk> , so Admiral William <unk> , commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning . Ozawa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north . 
 Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched an <unk> of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles ( 80 km ) ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers . <unk> claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on <unk> No. 2 . <unk> was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her <unk> and <unk> her superstructure with splinters . She took on a 5 @-@ degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier <unk> to safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful and <unk> had to be abandoned to her fate . 
 <unk> was attacked by 80 @-@ odd aircraft from the fourth wave , but they failed to inflict any serious damage . She <unk> 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once , on the <unk> <unk> of the port catapult . Some 34 other bombs near missed her , spraying her with splinters and <unk> some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms . While an exact total of her casualties is not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack . <unk> was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank <unk> . He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for <unk> <unk> . When they arrived on 27 October , Ozawa transferred to <unk> and <unk> his flag aboard her . While en route for <unk> , the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine . 
 In early November the <unk> were removed from both ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en route they were diverted to the <unk> Islands upon reports of heavy air raids at Manila . After off @-@ loading their cargo , they sailed for <unk> Island , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina and <unk> became flagship of the 5th Fleet there on 14 December . The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> transferred his flag to the light cruiser <unk> on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to <unk> . Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division . 
 The <unk> then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation <unk> ) . They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1 @,@ 150 <unk> workers , they were escorted by <unk> and three destroyers . <unk> Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached <unk> on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March <unk> was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and <unk> was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . <unk> was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown . 
 The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although it <unk> them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July . On the 24th <unk> was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks and <unk> began to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping . <unk> was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200 @-@ odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowly <unk> over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later . This time it was <unk> 's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war .

 Richard Gale " Dick " <unk> ( August 21 , 1926 – December 5 , 1994 ) was an American football player and a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to <unk> @-@ TV in Buffalo . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All @-@ America Team . <unk> played professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950 .

He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association ( <unk> ) state champion in both basketball and track and field . His college career was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the <unk> 's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943 .

 <unk> was born in <unk> , Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw , Michigan . <unk> was a star athlete at Saginaw 's Arthur Hill High School in football , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to the <unk> Class A high school basketball championship ( over Kalamazoo Central High School ) , scoring 24 points , including 17 in the second half , of the championship game . <unk> was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches ( 14 @.@ 30 m ) and high jump 5 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 74 m ) . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack <unk> ( ASIN <unk> ) , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County , Michigan . <unk> was named All State in football , basketball and track . 
 It is ironic that <unk> was born in <unk> , Michigan in 1926 for several reasons . Ted <unk> preceded <unk> as an All @-@ American end on the University of Michigan football team . <unk> had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County in <unk> competition . <unk> posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well . <unk> All @-@ American status as an end at Michigan would be <unk> 's next step after <unk> in <unk> competition .

 In the fall of 1944 , <unk> enrolled at the University of Michigan . The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about <unk> in September 1944 that opened as follows : " Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Michigan freshman . Every so often a great offensive end comes along , a player who has to learn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver . <unk> has laid claim to that rating . A loose @-@ <unk> 180 @-@ pound freshman from Saginaw , <unk> . , <unk> is being <unk> as the Big Ten 's next ' freshman sensation . ' " As a freshman , he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa . In an article titled " <unk> and <unk> , " Time reported on <unk> 's performance : " Of the few teams already in action , Michigan 's teens rang the freshman bell <unk> last week by winning their opener , 12 <unk> @-@ 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks ( Naval Pre @-@ Flight ) ; 6 @-@ ft . 4 Freshman End Dick <unk> caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns . " 
 <unk> 's college career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Navy , but after missing the 1945 season , he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948 . <unk> played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated National Championship seasons in 1947 and 1948 . He started nine games for the 1947 team . The 1947 team referred to as " Michigan 's Mad <unk> " is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . <unk> and teammate Len Ford had the reputation as the team practical <unk> . During the 1947 game against Wisconsin , <unk> started calling signals for the <unk> . Wisconsin 's offense protested to officials , who " <unk> the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man . " <unk> continued to scramble <unk> signals , as <unk> 's teammates laughed at his scheme . In the January 1 , 1948 Rose Bowl that season , Michigan rolled to a 49 – 0 victory over USC , and they <unk> the Trojans 491 yards to 133 . <unk> caught a 29 @-@ yard pass for the game 's final score . 
 In the 1948 championship season , <unk> scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards ( 508 receiving and 102 rushing ) . <unk> was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948 , and he was a consensus All @-@ American as a senior , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All @-@ American teams . <unk> led the Big Ten in receptions . 
 Although <unk> finished fourth among <unk> <unk> voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won the <unk> Trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All @-@ American teams . It is not clear why <unk> did not finish higher . However , it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern AP <unk> had voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players ( Bob Mann , Gene <unk> , and Len Ford ) were African @-@ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African @-@ American players . 
 <unk> was considered one of the greatest <unk> 's of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines , <unk> played in 32 games and had over 1 @,@ 000 yards of total offense . <unk> held the University of Michigan 's single season and career record for touchdown receptions ( eight in a season ; sixteen career ) until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980 .

 In 1948 , <unk> was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All @-@ America Football Conference . He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All @-@ Star Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the injury " will probably keep him out of pro football all season , if not forever . " The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playing with the college all @-@ stars . " 
 <unk> landed a job at <unk> radio in Detroit , but he left his <unk> 's job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season , <unk> came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions . <unk> recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 <unk> Trophy winner Leon Hart , who played the same position . 
 In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a <unk> by <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , <unk> hosted a popular panel show called " Let 's Talk Sports " in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program . He also worked for <unk> ( AM ) and <unk> ( FM ) and as the <unk> announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play @-@ by @-@ play announcer . In addition , he served as the play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team . As a radio broadcaster , he is remembered for things ranging from <unk> reports , to 17 years worth of " <unk> At — " programs live from various local restaurants , to 27 years as the <unk> @-@ AM All Night Show host . 
 After 30 years with <unk> and a change in ownership for the station , his show was replaced with the <unk> Network 's The Larry King Show .

 = 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane = 
 
 The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed east @-@ northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly west @-@ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , including <unk> and Harbour Island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many islands in its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wharves were ruined . 
 Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The hurricane moved across the state , passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees were <unk> in citrus groves . The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . Inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage ( 1933 USD ) after damaging or destroying 6 @,@ <unk> homes . 
 Unusually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 201 km / h ) winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession . 
 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 
 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @-@ northwest . On August 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east @-@ northeast of the Lesser Antilles . Based on continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the west @-@ northwest , the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on September 2 , a ship called the <unk> reported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks and <unk> islands , the hurricane struck <unk> and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 90 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during the 30 minute passage of the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . <unk> suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 . 
 The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . After moving through the northern Bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter , Florida , at <unk> UTC on September 4 . A station there reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 98 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during a 40 minute period of the eye 's passage ; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near <unk> — a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta .

 On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand <unk> , to <unk> Beach , Florida . While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne , Florida , with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar Key . About 2 @,@ 500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high tides sent sea <unk> over coastal <unk> in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings ; structures on <unk> Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a " solid front " of <unk> . Along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land . 
 The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Winds reached 110 mph ( 177 km / h ) at Governor 's Harbour , 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) on <unk> , and 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) on the <unk> Islands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on <unk> , <unk> away a dock . Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island , including to several roofs , the walls of government buildings , and the water system . The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 1 @.@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) road on <unk> was destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island . Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells , only five houses were destroyed , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs . <unk> between North Point , James <unk> , and Gregory Town on <unk> , the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others . On Grand <unk> , where a 9 to 12 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked . 
 When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach , <unk> measured at least 80 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 129 km / h ) winds with gusts to 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) ; <unk> ranged from 28 @.@ 64 to 28 @.@ 78 inHg ( 970 to <unk> mb ) . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph ( 64 to 72 km / h ) winds were observed in Miami to the south , <unk> to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph ( 129 to 145 km / h ) , and pressures dipped to 29 @.@ 14 inHg ( <unk> mb ) . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 17 @.@ 8 in ( 450 mm ) in <unk> . 
 At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several <unk> and royal <unk> that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped , <unk> streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , and <unk> covered the <unk> on a local golf course . Some <unk> and isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and <unk> roofing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no post @-@ storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth <unk> . Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed . 
 In Martin and St. Lucie counties , the storm was considered among the worst on record . The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations . At Stuart , winds removed or badly damaged 75 % of the roofs in town . The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling <unk> and the Stuart News , a local newspaper . At <unk> , an abandoned settlement also known as <unk> Beach , strong winds leveled the old <unk> Inn , a gas station , and the second floor of a <unk> building . Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island from <unk> was partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived by gripping the <unk> during the storm . Winds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at <unk> . The storm left many homes in <unk> Sound <unk> , forcing crews to tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While Stuart and <unk> Sound sustained significant damage , Port <unk> suffered <unk> . In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5 @,@ 100 at the time . Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce , the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines . In the latter city , high waves washed out a portion of the causeway . In the 1980s , an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce . 
 <unk> damage was worst along the Indian River <unk> ; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses , and <unk> , 16 % of the citrus crop , or 4 million boxes , were destroyed . Many chicken <unk> in Stuart were destroyed , and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as <unk> . Across southeastern Florida , the hurricane damaged 6 @,@ <unk> houses and destroyed another <unk> , causing over $ 3 million in damage . One person , an African American farm worker , was killed when his <unk> blew down in Gomez , a <unk> died after seven <unk> <unk> , and a child was killed by airborne debris . 
 High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , notably near Tampa where waters reached 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) deep . High rainfall of over 7 in ( 180 mm ) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of Tampa along the <unk> River . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions of <unk> Springs . Workers attempted to save the dam with <unk> , and after the break , most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood . Over 50 homes were flooded , forcing about 150 people to evacuate . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph ( 78 and 81 km / h ) in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , respectively . In the latter city , the storm spawned a tornado , which caused about $ 10 @,@ 000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in ( 300 mm ) . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina .

 In the Bahamas after the storm , a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to <unk> . 
 After the storm , the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart . Of the 7 @,@ 900 families adversely affected by the hurricane , 4 @,@ 325 required assistance from the American Red Cross . <unk> in Texas , also affected by a major hurricane , requested <unk> in Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell . The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the <unk> River being pumped into the city 's water treatment plant , and a new dam was eventually built in 1944 . 
 
 
 = Second Battle of <unk> <unk> = 
 
 The Second Battle of <unk> <unk> was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( <unk> ) forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along the <unk> River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . 
 After the First Battle of <unk> <unk> , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the <unk> River line . The division , which was <unk> in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> , promoting a fight there . 
 The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the <unk> <unk> region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at <unk> , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army .

 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in <unk> , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the <unk> 6th Division , and later the <unk> 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of <unk> , initially <unk> a UN counteroffensive before <unk> with battles at <unk> @-@ <unk> and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of <unk> , the <unk> 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division <unk> in the <unk> <unk> area . In the First Battle of <unk> <unk> , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the <unk> 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the <unk> region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of <unk> . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were <unk> from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working .

 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . <unk> by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround <unk> and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to <unk> . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The center attack called for the <unk> 9th Division , <unk> 4th Division , <unk> 2nd Division , and <unk> 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .

 During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division 's US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of <unk> River north of <unk> . On the 35th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the <unk> area of the <unk> where the First Battle of <unk> <unk> had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front . 
 During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the <unk> against a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry 's forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming . 
 On the west side of the <unk> , North Korean Major General <unk> <unk> Sam , commanding the <unk> 9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at <unk> <unk> by capturing the <unk> and <unk> areas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal between <unk> and Pusan . However , the North Koreans weren 't aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the <unk> River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the line . The North Koreans began crossing the <unk> River under cover of darkness at certain points .

 On the southern @-@ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the <unk> River with the <unk> , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge <unk> the <unk> that terminates in Hill 94 at the <unk> ferry site . The river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the <unk> passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called <unk> lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk> . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line . 
 That evening Sergeant Ernest R. <unk> led the patrol of two <unk> <unk> tanks and two <unk> Gun Motor <unk> in <unk> . <unk> placed his patrol on the west side of <unk> near the <unk> ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @-@ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing <unk> . Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water . 
 At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and <unk> saw that a North Korean <unk> bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . <unk> 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise . 
 <unk> 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . <unk> was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the <unk> site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near <unk> , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward . 
 The <unk> 9th Division 's infantry crossing of the <unk> and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge line positions near <unk> during the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the <unk> . On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .

 Meanwhile , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of <unk> and A Company 's position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hill <unk> overlooking the <unk> ferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> road came down to the <unk> and crossed it . The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the <unk> I Corps offensive rolled across the river . 
 Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the <unk> and observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the <unk> 9th Division . On August 25 , 9th Infantry commander Colonel John G. Hill outlined projected " Operation <unk> , " which was to be a company @-@ sized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence . 
 The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force <unk> on orders from the 2nd Division commander Major General Laurence B. <unk> , which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling . <unk> decided the patrol should cross the river at the <unk> ferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force . The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 . Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each to <unk> one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @-@ <unk> mortars , and one section of 75 @-@ <unk> recoilless rifles for supporting fires . A platoon of 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars was also to give support . 
 After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward <unk> of H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill <unk> , which was within B Company 's defense sector and overlooked the <unk> ferry crossing of the <unk> River . The raiding force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill <unk> where the <unk> prepared to set up their weapons . 
 By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill <unk> , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base . The regimental <unk> , Captain Lewis B. Sheen , had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill <unk> , <unk> Sheen and men in B Company after dark heard <unk> in the water below them . They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers wading the river . 
 The first North Korean crossing at the <unk> ferry caught the Heavy <unk> Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill <unk> , <unk> miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division canceled Operation <unk> because of the attacks . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack <unk> the men below . It <unk> on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night . 
 From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the <unk> 9th Division crossed the <unk> at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before building <unk> bridges for their vehicles and armor . 
 At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a whistle sounded , then came a shouted order , and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force <unk> group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night . But higher up on Hill <unk> the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September . 
 At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road and take a blocking position at the pass between <unk> Hill and <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from <unk> . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the <unk> <unk> . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T @-@ 34 at <unk> , also called <unk> . E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions <unk> the road east of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and <unk> 's aide who had accompanied the force . With the critical parts of <unk> Hill and <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , the best defensive terrain between <unk> and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of <unk> on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .

 North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge . It took over a 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) <unk> River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L. Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E. <unk> , Jr . , <unk> the hills with platoons and squads . He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector . On August <unk> the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the <unk> River to <unk> . The main road bent south along the east bank of the river to <unk> @-@ <unk> and then turned northeast to <unk> . A northern secondary road curved around <unk> and lakes , the largest of which was Lake U @-@ p <unk> , to <unk> . In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to <unk> . 
 The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) front along the east bank of the <unk> north of <unk> @-@ <unk> . Across the river in the rice <unk> they could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers . Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river . They immediately reported to the battalion command post . The artillery forward observer , who estimated the column at 2 @,@ 000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number . However the North Koreans continued their advance . 
 At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line . 
 On the regimental left along the main <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @-@ p <unk> and the hills there covering the northern road into <unk> , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action . 
 When word of the disaster that had <unk> 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward <unk> @-@ <unk> and C Company . Major Lloyd K. Jenson , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down the <unk> @-@ <unk> road . This force was unable to reach C Company , but Jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high ground <unk> this main approach to <unk> near <unk> <unk> @-@ ri above Lake <unk> , and went into a defensive position there . The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the <unk> Regiment in front of <unk> . North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other <unk> regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of <unk> .

 Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north @-@ south <unk> @-@ <unk> road and cut the division in two ; the 38th and <unk> Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . <unk> decided that this situation made it <unk> to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of <unk> . Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 . <unk> , in the <unk> area , <unk> placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other <unk> units of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley . 
 All three regiments of the <unk> 2nd Division @-@ the 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to south @-@ crossed during the night to the east side of the <unk> River into the 23rd Regiment sector . The <unk> 2nd Division , concentrated in the <unk> @-@ <unk> area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into <unk> above and below Lake U @-@ p <unk> . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @-@ p <unk> was a large body of water although in most places very shallow . 
 At dawn September 1 , <unk> at 2nd Division headquarters in <unk> @-@ <unk> , 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of <unk> on the <unk> road , felt his division was in the midst of a crisis . The massive North Korean attack had made deep <unk> everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The <unk> 9th Division had effected major <unk> of the <unk> at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the <unk> 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major <unk> against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the <unk> 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill <unk> area near <unk> 'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . At 08 : 10 <unk> telephoned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Korean <unk> were in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 <unk> planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front @-@ line units . Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light aviation section of the division artillery located front @-@ line units cut off by the North Koreans , and made fourteen <unk> of ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe <unk> elsewhere . The front @-@ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of <unk> and some companies had virtually disappeared . <unk> hoped he could organize a defense along the <unk> @-@ <unk> road east of the <unk> River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to <unk> and Ch <unk> . 
 
 = = = Reinforcements = = = 
 
 At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along the <unk> River from <unk> @-@ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in the <unk> <unk> @-@ Seoul area and <unk> southward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the <unk> area . 
 During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , <unk> in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the <unk> I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @-@ the <unk> 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the <unk> 7th Division and <unk> 6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of <unk> , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to <unk> and the main Pusan @-@ <unk> railroad and highway . 
 Eighth Army had in reserve three <unk> infantry regiments and the 2 @-@ battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at <unk> , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of <unk> , preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at <unk> only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in the <unk> area ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters at <unk> southeast of <unk> . Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment 's notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an <unk> destination . 
 As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the <unk> <unk> area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened <unk> and with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the <unk> <unk> at 13 : 30 .

 The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the <unk> ferry , captured <unk> , and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions from <unk> northward . A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east . After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to <unk> to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition . 
 Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the <unk> below A Company . The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire . When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the <unk> to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . <unk> <unk> artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night . 
 During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this desperate action , Private First Class Luther H. Story , a weapons squad leader , fought so <unk> that he was awarded the Medal of Honor . <unk> wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by <unk> toward <unk> . From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of <unk> which was then in progress . That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near <unk> . <unk> from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well . 
 
 = = = The end of Task Force <unk> = = = 
 
 In the meantime , Task Force <unk> was still holding its position along the <unk> River , about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of where A Company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line . The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies , 9th Infantry , who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck , was on a southern <unk> of Hill <unk> , 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south of B Company 's higher position . In addition to the D and H Company men , there were a few from the Heavy <unk> Platoon and one or two from B Company . <unk> , 60 to 70 men were in the group . The group had an <unk> @-@ 300 radio , a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , a <unk> <unk> <unk> Rifle , about 20 <unk> <unk> rifles , and about 40 <unk> or pistols . <unk> assumed command of the group . 
 During the night <unk> established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came <unk> and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher <unk> half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force <unk> group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . <unk> of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter . 
 In the afternoon of September 2 <unk> <unk> 1st Battalion for an <unk> of supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R. <unk> , of H Company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the North Korean dead . On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked <unk> , who killed the North Korean in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . 
 That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to <unk> with the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . " <unk> in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean <unk> fire came in on the <unk> and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill <unk> swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars <unk> on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on <unk> 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his <unk> . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man . 
 The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar <unk> had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . <unk> later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every <unk> . <unk> fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by <unk> never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times <unk> <unk> from his <unk> to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action <unk> was killed . Most of the <unk> of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed <unk> on September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J. <unk> of D Company , senior surviving officer . 
 At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , <unk> decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , <unk> and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his <unk> condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his <unk> be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like <unk> , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the <unk> downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division . 
 Members of Task Force <unk> who escaped from Hill <unk> brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the <unk> ferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed a <unk> bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning . <unk> parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 800 @-@ 1 @,@ 000 carriers being used at this crossing site . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the <unk> <unk> and around <unk> , the US <unk> Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , <unk> regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3 @-@ hour fight . 
 The North Koreans advanced to <unk> itself during the afternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Koreans were in <unk> that evening . With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the <unk> road in an effort to re @-@ establish communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks . Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to <unk> . There , it delivered an <unk> of Task Force Haynes ' positions to Bradley . 
 Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 , <unk> had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of <unk> . In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hill <unk> overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill <unk> dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill <unk> against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket and <unk> strikes . 
 This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill <unk> killing 150 North Koreans . From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artillery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill , <unk> 's men found twenty @-@ five American <unk> and <unk> guns , a large American radio , thirty boxes of <unk> American fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some American rations .

 Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the <unk> area . At 14 : 00 a tank @-@ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion 's defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies . That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C @-@ 47 <unk> planes supplied the battalion by <unk> . 
 On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near <unk> @-@ <unk> to open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill <unk> north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position . 
 On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd 's sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to <unk> . The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans from <unk> and from its supply road .

 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the <unk> 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short of <unk> after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at <unk> <unk> , but division commander Major General <unk> <unk> Sam felt the chances of capturing <unk> were strong . 
 On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend <unk> . <unk> in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to <unk> . The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around <unk> on the northwest . 
 A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , moved to the south side of the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> an estimated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight . <unk> Gun Motor <unk> of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the approval of General Bradley , D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking <unk> . A platoon of infantry went into position behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of <unk> on the left flank of D Company . There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road to <unk> came south out of <unk> , bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to <unk> . 
 North Koreans had also approached <unk> from the south . The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a sharp fight . In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself . He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns . Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank 's <unk> and <unk> and scored more than 50 hits on it . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south . 
 At 09 : 35 September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of <unk> and clear the road to <unk> , Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. <unk> , Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions . He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them . He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them . <unk> replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after this conversation Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the <unk> River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished . 
 A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D Battery of the <unk> AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division . Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan @-@ <unk> area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of <unk> and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River . There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone . 
 The American counteroffensive of September 3 – 5 west of <unk> , according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the <unk> <unk> of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the <unk> 9th Division , supported by the low strength <unk> 4th Division , still held <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , <unk> Hill , and the intervening ground back to the <unk> on September 6 , the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The <unk> 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive . 
 
 = = = <unk> 2nd Division destroyed = = = 
 
 The <unk> 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter in the <unk> hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to A Company 's position . There he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of <unk> it into the gap in F Company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain . 
 The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent . 
 This heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the <unk> 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in <unk> @-@ <unk> , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded in the fighting west of <unk> . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies . <unk> daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town . 
 North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the <unk> River for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack .

 The UN counterattack at <unk> collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the <unk> River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9 @,@ 350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . The 2nd Division numbered 6 @,@ 000 . Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight . The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All of <unk> II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after <unk> , was on the brink of defeat . 
 By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1 @,@ 120 killed , 2 @,@ <unk> wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of <unk> <unk> the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 17 @,@ <unk> on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at <unk> . 
 Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of <unk> <unk> is seen by historians as the most serious threat . It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing <unk> , where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . However , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of <unk> a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed .

 <unk> <unk> , also known as ( <unk> ) Planet Earth and stylized as ( <unk> ) <unk> , is an American rock band from Huntington Beach , California . Formed in 1994 , the band performs a style of music which it refers to as " G @-@ punk " , a fusion of punk rock and <unk> rap . 
 After releasing three albums on <unk> Records , <unk> <unk> left the label to record independently , eventually signing with <unk> <unk> Records in 2006 . Since 2006 , the band has become known for its involvement in the 9 / 11 Truth movement , referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts , as well as the concept of the album New World <unk> .

 = <unk> warship = 
 
 An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored <unk> in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ <unk> armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the <unk> ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . 
 <unk> were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers . The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ <unk> vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built , <unk> battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns ( the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible . 
 The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers . 
 
 = = The ironclad = = 
 
 The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J. Richard Hill : " The ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @-@ skinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells . It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . " Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads . 
 
 = = = Steam propulsion = = = 
 
 In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . While <unk> steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s . 
 Steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement . 
 The introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production . <unk> , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 . 
 
 = = = <unk> shells = = = 
 
 The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on <unk> . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French <unk> Henri @-@ Joseph <unk> , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of <unk> , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ <unk> warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could <unk> in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . 
 
 = = = Iron armor = = = 
 
 The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships ' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat <unk> , built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also from Laird , the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates <unk> and <unk> for the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal <unk> like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire . 
 Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of <unk> , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <unk> guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames and <unk> Iron Works within the docks . 
 The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist <unk> mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of <unk> on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteries <unk> and Meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at <unk> . The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at <unk> . 
 The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of <unk> , but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their <unk> . 
 
 = = Early ironclad ships and battles = = 
 
 By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . The result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad , the Gloire , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859 . 
 Gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck , <unk> in iron plates 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with thirty @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled guns . France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and the only two @-@ <unk> broadside ironclads ever built , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would <unk> the French ships in every respect , particularly speed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her <unk> to enemy fire . The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warrior @-@ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily compromises between ' sea @-@ keeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) . Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and Resistance ) were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected . The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to <unk> by marine life . 
 By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads . However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing , <unk> designs of Gloire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of <unk> , had an important influence on the development of ironclad design . 
 
 = = = First battles between ironclads : the U.S. Civil War = = = 
 
 The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> frigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships . 
 On 12 October 1861 , the CSS <unk> became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of <unk> . She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk . <unk> on the hull of USS <unk> , Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad <unk> , when she entered the Confederate navy . By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to complete the USS <unk> , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson . The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New <unk> , and the smaller USS <unk> . 
 The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored <unk> was deployed to protect the Union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily . 
 The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the <unk> warships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSS <unk> was completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war . 
 Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union 's attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS <unk> , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate New <unk> and a light @-@ draft USS <unk> , participated in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CSS <unk> State and CSS <unk> participated in the defence of the harbor . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tennessee , the Confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma . 
 On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted <unk> and then contracting engineer James <unk> of St. Louis , Missouri to build the City @-@ class ironclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central <unk> wheel , all protected by an armored <unk> . They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations . <unk> also produced monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which differed from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they contained a <unk> wheel ( the USS <unk> and USS Osage ) . 
 <unk> <unk> vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served <unk> with the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard <unk> but with armored side @-@ mounted <unk> wheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful ( or disastrous ) than others , confirmed the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be <unk> in every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , Brown & Blue @-@ water operations . 
 The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative <unk> to enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as the ocean @-@ going monitors of the Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Confederate vessels . 
 
 = = = <unk> : First fleet battle = = = 
 
 The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of <unk> in 1866 . <unk> between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and <unk> and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of <unk> . Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built <unk> — a double @-@ <unk> ram . <unk> them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates . 
 The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into an <unk> formation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron . In the <unk> which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of <unk> — nonetheless , the effective <unk> attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years . 
 The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads , Re d 'Italia and Palestro , while the Austrian <unk> screw two @-@ <unk> SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads . The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years , and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic . 
 The battles of the American Civil War and at <unk> were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In particular , it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy ironclads . 
 
 = = Armament and tactics = = 
 
 The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread . The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside , in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @-@ round fire . 
 
 = = = Ram craze = = = 
 
 From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making them <unk> to <unk> , the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow . 
 The <unk> damage inflicted by the guns of <unk> and Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d 'Italia at <unk> gave strength to the <unk> craze . From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by <unk> struggled to be heard . 
 The revival of <unk> had a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . This tactic was totally unsuited to <unk> , and the ram threw fleet tactics into <unk> . The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water . 
 The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns . 
 
 = = = Development of naval guns = = = 
 
 The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . Throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading . 
 HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns . Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament ; the breech @-@ <unk> she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service . 
 <unk> @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech @-@ <unk> could be <unk> without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because of their <unk> , more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @-@ <unk> for decades . 
 The weakness of the breech @-@ <unk> was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion <unk> the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also <unk> great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies . 
 These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s . After a brief introduction of 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) smoothbore Somerset Gun , which weighed 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) , the Admiralty introduced 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasingly <unk> weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) . 
 The decision to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech @-@ <unk> , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns . 
 From 1875 onwards , the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de <unk> invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as <unk> , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of <unk> in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . In 1882 , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of HMS <unk> fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the <unk> <unk> . The 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns of <unk> <unk> could each fire a round every 15 minutes . 
 In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @-@ <unk> was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion was <unk> by an explosion on board HMS <unk> caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun . 
 The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest <unk> of gun ever used at sea . HMS <unk> carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( <unk> mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could <unk> the advantage of <unk> . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' <unk> ' along the surface of the water . <unk> effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of <unk> — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the <unk> ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns . 
 Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the <unk> fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The <unk> of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into <unk> , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which <unk> more slowly again . It also put less stress on the <unk> of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to <unk> <unk> . 
 The development of <unk> powder , based on <unk> or <unk> , by the French inventor Paul <unk> in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved <unk> to gain greater muzzle velocity . 
 The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @-@ piercing <unk> was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . Later , shot of <unk> iron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities . Eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed .

 The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called " broadside ironclads . " Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type . Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck . 
 A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one <unk> at a time , and the rigging did not impede the field of fire . 
 <unk> armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . <unk> guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption of <unk> as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire . These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire , which included central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs . 
 
 = = = = <unk> , batteries and barbettes = = = = 
 
 There were two main design <unk> to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or <unk> , a barbette . 
 The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . <unk> guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a broadside type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . Centre @-@ battery ships often , but not always , had a <unk> <unk> enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead . 
 The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS <unk> in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor <unk> <unk> with a prototype of this installed on HMS <unk> in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and <unk> 's turned on a ring of bearings . <unk> offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low <unk> . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low <unk> , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the <unk> , low @-@ <unk> <unk> and the broadside <unk> HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' <unk> ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' <unk> this circle ' , was designed by Captain <unk> <unk> <unk> : HMS Captain , a dangerously low <unk> turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams . The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS <unk> of 1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside . 
 A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a <unk> . The crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable to <unk> fire , for instance from shore emplacements . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships . The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , transformed into the turrets of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships .

 The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped <unk> the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative <unk> of <unk> against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or <unk> ; either to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less <unk> . 
 A more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or Whitehead torpedo . <unk> in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS <unk> and the Italian <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . The ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In practice , however , the <unk> <unk> was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads .

 The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden <unk> . <unk> were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s . 
 
 = = = <unk> : iron , wood and steel = = = 
 
 Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull . However , <unk> iron had many military disadvantages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for long @-@ range cruising warships . 
 Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron @-@ <unk> but <unk> gunboats and frigates . However , the iron @-@ <unk> frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood . 
 The <unk> of <unk> iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , for instance the use of <unk> bulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , built of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ <unk> Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of <unk> . And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @-@ <unk> ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought . 
 Wooden hulls continued to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quick <unk> by marine life , slowing the ships down — <unk> for a European <unk> close to dry docks , but a difficulty for long @-@ range ships . The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable : the Japanese <unk> and <unk> ordered in 1875 were sister @-@ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction . 
 After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the <unk> , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 . <unk> nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel . 
 Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . The <unk> process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use on ships . French manufacturers used the <unk> @-@ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technology <unk> behind . The first all @-@ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels <unk> and Mercury , laid down in 1875 and 1876 . 
 
 = = = Armor and protection schemes = = = 
 
 Iron @-@ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of <unk> , the strongest shipbuilding wood . The wood played two roles , preventing <unk> and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS <unk> . 
 Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and <unk> when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( starting with HMS <unk> ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS <unk> of 1882 ) . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor . 
 The first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the Italian <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 . 
 The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . For several years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , produced in the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firm <unk> developed gas <unk> , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' <unk> armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Canopus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships used <unk> armor , though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade . 
 The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 mm ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @.@ 75 in ( 197 mm ) of Harvey armor or 5 @.@ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of <unk> armor . 
 <unk> construction also <unk> the later debate in battleship design between <unk> and ' all @-@ or @-@ nothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @-@ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished . <unk> 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . An ingenious arrangement of <unk> @-@ filled compartments and <unk> bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections . 
 
 = = <unk> : steam and sail = = 
 
 The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low <unk> ) , and a <unk> funnel which could be folded down to the deck level . 
 Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the <unk> , or USS <unk> and her sisters , <unk> with masts from the beginning . The British HMS <unk> , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to <unk> with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The <unk> and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently <unk> ironclads . 
 During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of <unk> problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
 During the 1870s the distinction grew between ' first @-@ class ironclads ' or ' battleships ' on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for long @-@ range work on the other . The demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly <unk> . HMS <unk> , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships . 
 <unk> persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma and La <unk> classes as small , long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS <unk> of 1870 . The Russian ship General @-@ Admiral , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to <unk> and <unk> ships like <unk> . Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to <unk> General @-@ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a retractable <unk> , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig , <unk> speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which was completed in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century . 
 The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) .

 While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide . <unk> remained , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers . But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy @-@ makers of the increasing <unk> of strictly naval foreign intervention , from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the <unk> combined defences of naval <unk> such as <unk> and Cherbourg . 
 There were many types of ironclads : 
 <unk> ships intended to " stand in the line of battle " ; the precursors of the battleship . 
 Coastal service and <unk> vessels , including ' floating batteries ' and ' <unk> 
 <unk> intended for commerce raiding or protection of commerce , called ' armoured <unk>

 The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period . The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of <unk> , this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of ' coast @-@ defence battleships ' , starting with the <unk> class . These ' <unk> monitors ' were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship . As long @-@ range monitors they could reach Bermuda <unk> , for example . However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of <unk> by the close of the Crimean War , but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monitors proved <unk> unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the American conflict , though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running <unk> . <unk> and obstructions , however , negated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . The British never laid down enough <unk> @-@ class ' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg , <unk> or even New York City with gunfire . Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which promulgated the idea of a ' two @-@ power standard ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s . 
 British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . <unk> British interests against Ahmed ' <unk> 's Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy ( for accuracy 's sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured <unk> . 
 The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently out @-@ built by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats and <unk> cruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco @-@ Prussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land . 
 Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Nonetheless , there were real innovations from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser , the General @-@ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ' <unk> ' ( for Admiral <unk> , who conceived the design ) . The Russian Navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 . 
 The U.S. Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @-@ <unk> and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of naval warfare . 
 <unk> were widely used in South America . Both sides used ironclads in the <unk> Islands War between Spain and the combined forces of Peru and Chile in the early 1860s . The powerful Spanish <unk> participated in the Battle of <unk> but was unable to inflict significant damage to the <unk> defences . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs , the <unk> ( a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad ) and the Victoria ( a small monitor armed with a single 68 @-@ <unk> gun ) , as well as two British @-@ built ironclads : <unk> , a centre @-@ battery ship , and the turret ship <unk> . <unk> was the first ironclad to <unk> the world , arriving in <unk> on 20 September 1867 , and earning the motto : " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " [ " First ironclad ship to sail around the world " ] ) . In the War of the Pacific in 1879 , both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those used a few years previously against Spain . While the <unk> ran aground early on , the Peruvian ironclad ' <unk> made a great impact against Chilean shipping , delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months . She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centre @-@ battery ironclads , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> at the Battle of <unk> Point . 
 <unk> were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The <unk> ( Japanese : <unk> , literally " <unk> " , later renamed <unk> <unk> , " East " ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of <unk> Bay in May 1869 , which marked the end of the <unk> War , and the complete establishment of the <unk> Restoration . The <unk> continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers . These ships engaged the Chinese <unk> fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the <unk> River . <unk> to superior short @-@ range firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four . The naval war was concluded the next year at the Battle of <unk> , where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese . 
 
 = = End of the ironclad warship = = 
 
 There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad , besides the transition from wood hulls to all @-@ metal . <unk> continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century , the descriptions ' battleship ' and ' armored cruiser ' came to replace the term ' ironclad ' . 
 The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships , producing the type known as the pre @-@ <unk> . These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship . The next evolution of battleship design , the dreadnought , is never referred to as an ' ironclad ' . 
 Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the 1900s ( decade ) . For instance , a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre @-@ <unk> battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II .

 The example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas of <unk> and other armored vehicles . H. G. Wells , in his short story The Land <unk> , published in The Strand Magazine in December 1903 , described the use of large , armoured cross @-@ country vehicles , armed with cannon and machine guns , and equipped with <unk> wheels

 = Little <unk> ( poem ) = 
 
 Little <unk> is the fourth and final poem of T. S. Eliot 's Four <unk> , a series of poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and salvation . It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot 's declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in <unk> , established by Nicholas <unk> in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War . 
 The poem uses the combined image of fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need for purification and <unk> . According to the poet , humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be overcome by <unk> the lessons of the past . Within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Little <unk> focuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Following the completion of the third Four <unk> poem , The Dry <unk> , Eliot 's health declined and he stayed in <unk> Green , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Little <unk> . The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain . 
 After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Little <unk> was intended to conclude the Four <unk> series , <unk> Eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems . 
 Little <unk> was the home of an Anglican community established in <unk> by Nicholas <unk> . The <unk> household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between <unk> and <unk> but reformed , ending with the death of John <unk> in <unk> . Eliot had visited the site in May 1936 . 
 Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Four <unk> poems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community . As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community . 
 
 = = Poem = = 
 
 Critics classify Little <unk> as a poem of fire with an emphasis on <unk> and the <unk> fire . The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things <unk> , and regret for past events . 
 While using Dante 's <unk> <unk> style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain . The image of warfare <unk> with the depiction of <unk> , and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art in general , and how humankind is flawed . The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience <unk> through fire . The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich 's writing about God 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of <unk> , a shirt that burns its wearer . Little <unk> continues by describing the <unk> of the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal of humankind . 
 
 = = Themes = = 
 
 In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin . The original Little <unk> community was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit , <unk> , communion with the dead , and the repetition of history . The theme is also internal to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little <unk> is the image that begins <unk> Norton and the journey is made circular . Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family <unk> . 
 Like the other poems making up the Four <unk> , Little <unk> deals with the past , present , and future , and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states " Knowing myself yet being someone other " . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction . God 's love allows humankind to be <unk> and escape the living hell through <unk> by fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society . 
 The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as " <unk> <unk> " before being revised as an ambiguous " you " . " <unk> <unk> " was Dante 's way of addressing <unk> <unk> , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for <unk> . Eliot , in a letter to John <unk> dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording : 
 I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of <unk> for two reasons . The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . However , I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to <unk> to him the particular vice which took <unk> there . <unk> , although the reference to that <unk> is intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the whole to be <unk> which is more appropriate . That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of <unk> 26 where the poets are found . 
 The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of <unk> <unk> , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in <unk> <unk> . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing , an act that appears throughout Yeats 's poetry , within <unk> flames . The critic Dominic <unk> suggests that , in combining the image of dancing with <unk> , Eliot <unk> Dante 's and Yeats 's poetic themes . 
 
 = = Reception = = 
 
 Critics such as Malcolm <unk> and <unk> <unk> describe mixed emotions about the <unk> of the poem . <unk> emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than <unk> while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages . <unk> also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little <unk> . F. B. <unk> believed that the fourth section of the poem costs " Eliot more trouble and <unk> than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement in the Four <unk> . " E. M. Forster did not like Eliot 's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : " Of course there 's pain on and off through each individual 's life ... You can 't <unk> it and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and <unk> by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and <unk> ? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer . " Writing in 2003 , Roger <unk> wrote that in " Little <unk> " Eliot achieved " that for which he <unk> Dante — namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language " .

 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> is a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler ( <unk> ) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II . The book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors . There Hitler maintains that Israel <unk> its existence to the Holocaust and that he is the " benefactor of the Jews " . 
 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was a 1983 <unk> in the <unk> / Faulkner Award for Fiction . It was adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton and was staged in London in April 1982 with Alec <unk> playing the part of Adolf Hitler .

 From his base in Tel Aviv , Holocaust survivor Emmanuel <unk> directs a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler . <unk> believes that the former <unk> is still alive , and following rumours and <unk> , he tracks Hitler 's movements through South America , until after months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90 @-@ year @-@ old alive in a clearing . <unk> flies to San <unk> where he awaits the group 's return with their captive . But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in , and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms . 
 Meanwhile , broken and incoherent radio messages between <unk> and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress , and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler 's capture . <unk> flare up over his impending trial , where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction . <unk> is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party , and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search party loses radio contact with <unk> , they must make a decision : do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to <unk> later , or do they try Hitler in the jungle before their prize is <unk> from them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their decision is the latter , and against <unk> 's advice ( " You must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other " ) they prepare for a trial with a judge , prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party . <unk> , a local Indian <unk> , is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness . 
 The attention Hitler is receiving , however , <unk> his strength , and when the trial begins , he <unk> aside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence : 
 Firstly , Hitler claims he took his doctrines from the Jews and copied the notion of the master race from the <unk> people and their need to separate themselves from the " <unk> " . " My racism is a parody of <unk> , a hungry imitation . " 
 Hitler <unk> the Final <unk> by maintaining that the Jews ' God , <unk> than any other , <unk> its subjects , continually demanding more than they can give and " <unk> " them with ideals that cannot be attained . The " virus of <unk> " had to be stopped . 
 Hitler states that he was not the originator of evil . " [ Stalin ] had <unk> <unk> when I was still a <unk> <unk> in Munich . " Further , Hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are <unk> by various world atrocities , including those in Russia , China and Africa . 
 Lastly , Hitler maintains that the Reich <unk> Israel and suggests that he is the <unk> " whose infamous <unk> were allowed by God in order to bring His people home . " He closes by asking , " Should you not honour me who have made ... <unk> a reality ? " 
 At the end of his speech , <unk> is the first to react and jumps up shouting " <unk> " , only to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing .

 George Steiner , literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books , including <unk> <unk> ( 1964 ) , Language and Silence ( 1967 ) and In <unk> 's Castle ( 1971 ) . Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> were reworked from these earlier works . Steiner told New York Times editor D. J. R. <unk> that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language . " Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my <unk> ... that you can use human speech both to <unk> , to love , to build , to forgive and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to <unk> . " 
 Commenting on the controversy the book generated , Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron <unk> ( author of Explaining Hitler ) that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him , " <unk> or <unk> @-@ like " . He said that it felt like the book " wrote me " . Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia , Vietnam , El Salvador and <unk> : " My feeling is that one has to <unk> with the <unk> if one can . " 
 Steiner wrote The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and the 120 @-@ page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of <unk> , the British literary magazine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 by <unk> and <unk> in the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster .

 Reaction to The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was mixed . Anthony <unk> in The Observer called it " astonishing " , Christopher Booker of The Daily Telegraph described it as a " powerful piece " , and English author A. S. <unk> said it was a " masterpiece " . In Explaining Hitler , Ron <unk> called The Portage " A <unk> story " , referring to Steiner 's <unk> Hitler has having taken on a life of its own . Writing in Time magazine , Otto Friedrich described the book " a <unk> fantasy of remarkable intensity " , adding that by not <unk> Hitler 's speech , Steiner <unk> from the <unk> of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book " on a note of bleak ambiguity " . 
 Morris <unk> of The New York Times was more critical of the book , calling it " a <unk> and badly executed novel , a <unk> distraction from the serious business of thinking through the <unk> <unk> of the Nazi era . " He described it as " <unk> " that is " <unk> [ d ] " by too much " fine writing " ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . He also complained that the characters are lifeless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only " verbal <unk> " that do not separate them from one another . Finally <unk> noted that because almost all the points of Hitler 's speech are drawn from some of Steiner 's earlier works , he " unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also <unk> and brilliant — at once <unk> harmless and <unk> dangerous . " 
 In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , " some wit , a <unk> disdain , multiplicity of character and a South American swamp @-@ life that <unk> " , its weaknesses are that " the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by <unk> and <unk> " . But Leonard 's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler 's speech , which he called " obscene " , and Steiner 's decision to end the book at that point , which Leonard said " not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend , but ... makes me sick to my stomach . " 
 Writing in the American literary magazine <unk> , Alvin H. <unk> called The Portage a " breakthrough work " that " <unk> " . He was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the " landscape of speech " — the former being " brilliantly registered " with its " immense feeling of <unk> " , and the latter , " even more dramatic " in the way it exposes " the dark underside of words " and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person . He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel <unk> and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness . <unk> noted that while Holocaust literature often either <unk> to " <unk> and apostrophe " , or sinks to " a <unk> <unk> of elegiac lament " , Steiner 's <unk> " <unk> between these two extremes , ... simultaneously records and <unk> , <unk> <unk> yet carries an immense affect " . What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " virtually <unk> " into Hitler 's mouth , creating the impression that " Steiner 's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ understanding " . <unk> also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler 's speech . He said that Steiner 's <unk> Hitler plays " the devil 's game of language subversion " , making " madness [ sound ] like music " , something the real Hitler had <unk> . By stopping at this point , <unk> felt that Steiner " <unk> [ s ] , <unk> , to the seductive <unk> of negation " , which <unk> his own " high standards of moral intelligence " . But overall <unk> said The Portage " must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to confront him " in a way hardly seen before in fiction " . 
 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was a <unk> in the 1983 <unk> / Faulkner Award for Fiction . 
 
 = = Controversy = = 
 
 The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation ( " too faithful " , according to Steiner ) was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States . 
 Hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics . Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious . One critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as " the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil " , felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner 's own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , of anti @-@ Semitism . 
 In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner 's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book regarding Hitler : " There shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of madness and <unk> and make them seem music . " 
 Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler 's speech in this book is <unk> by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan 's speech in Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , and The Grand <unk> 's speech in <unk> 's The Brothers <unk> ( 1880 ) . He also reminded the reader that Hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by <unk> 's long monologue on the <unk> of the Holocaust . Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is " a <unk> figure " , and that it is not he who has the last word , but <unk> , the Indian <unk> , who shouts " <unk> " . <unk> is also the Hebrew word used to indicate that " there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide . "

 <unk> ( from Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " to cut " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " <unk> " ) ) is a diverse <unk> of extinct small to giant <unk> — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . <unk> have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the <unk> stage , <unk> , and maturity . Most <unk> were <unk> , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These <unk> were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although <unk> are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @-@ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians . 
 <unk> have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in <unk> were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . <unk> means " cut vertebrae " , as each <unk> is divided into several parts . 
 Experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , <unk> , and <unk> ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> , another group of early <unk> called <unk> , or even as descendants of both groups ( with <unk> evolving from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolving from <unk> ) . Recent studies place a family of <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives of modern amphibians . <unk> in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 Many <unk> are much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble <unk> . Others are smaller and resemble <unk> . Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt ( <unk> ) or elongated ( <unk> ) . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood ( early <unk> <unk> would have had difficulty <unk> carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land , and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . Many <unk> also have canal @-@ like grooves in their skulls called sensory <unk> . The <unk> , which usually run around the nostrils and eye <unk> , are part of a lateral line system used to detect <unk> in water . As <unk> animals , most <unk> have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . <unk> <unk> have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial <unk> , <unk> , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey . 
 <unk> of most of the bones of <unk> are also seen in other early <unk> , aside from a few bones in the skull , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that have developed in some <unk> taxa . Most <unk> have <unk> horns in the backs of their skulls , rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by <unk> called <unk> <unk> ; in some <unk> , such as <unk> , they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing features of <unk> are the <unk> <unk> , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes , <unk> , are present in front of these <unk> , and connect the nasal passage with the mouth . <unk> often have teeth on their <unk> , as well as in their jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as <unk> . In some <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> in the lower jaw <unk> the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull . 
 Very little is known of the soft tissue of <unk> . A block of sandstone , described in 2007 from the Early <unk> <unk> <unk> Formation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three <unk> . These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with <unk> feet , and a ridge of skin on their <unk> . <unk> <unk> to small <unk> have also been found in <unk> and <unk> rocks . The <unk> , called <unk> , are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water . 
 Unlike modern amphibians , many <unk> are covered in small , closely packed scales . The <unk> of most <unk> are covered in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales . <unk> show , as the animals grew , the scales on the <unk> of their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later <unk> <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow <unk> <unk> , the absorption of oxygen through the skin . 
 Several groups of <unk> have large bony plates on their backs . One <unk> , <unk> , has armour @-@ like plating that covers both its back and underside . The <unk> <unk> also has extensive plating on its back . Most members of the family <unk> also have armor , although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates . Other <unk> , such as <unk> , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony <unk> that were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of these <unk> were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of <unk> . The <unk> may have provided stability for the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments . <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . <unk> <unk> are also seen in <unk> , but unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic . <unk> may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both <unk> and <unk> have been considered close relatives of the group . 
 <unk> ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living <unk> , the main body of the <unk> is a single piece of bone called the <unk> , but in <unk> , this region was divided into a <unk> and <unk> . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in <unk> : <unk> and <unk> vertebrae . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the <unk> are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed <unk> projections called <unk> strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many <unk> <unk> allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> have been lost entirely , with the <unk> enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the <unk> <unk> spent more time in water . 
 
 = = History of study = = 
 
 <unk> was named by German <unk> Karl Alfred von <unk> in his second edition of <unk> der <unk> , published in 1888 . <unk> remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however . The earliest described <unk> was <unk> , named by Georg Friedrich <unk> in 1828 . <unk> named <unk> from a single tooth , and considered it a reptile . <unk> means " breast tooth lizard " after the <unk> @-@ like shape of the tip of the tooth . 
 The naming of these first specimens was disputed , however . Leopold <unk> named the animal <unk> in 1837 . In 1841 , English <unk> Richard Owen referred to the genus as <unk> to describe its highly folded or <unk> teeth . Owen thought the name <unk> " ought not to be retained , because it recalls <unk> the idea of the mammalian genus <unk> , or else a <unk> form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word , <unk> , indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the <unk> , but to the <unk> order of <unk> . " Owen recognized the animal was not a " <unk> " reptile , yet he also referred <unk> 's <unk> to the genus . Although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth , <unk> was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placed <unk> as an amphibian . <unk> also named <unk> <unk> in 1828 , basing it on partial <unk> , or back portion of the skull . In 1833 , he described a complete skull of S. <unk> that had the same teeth as his <unk> , making it the first known complete skull of a <unk> . Because <unk> was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior <unk> synonym . <unk> is still used as the name of an unrelated <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> and other similar animals were referred to as <unk> , named like <unk> for teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen 's " <unk> <unk> " was later found at Guy 's <unk> , England by paleontologist William Buckland . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted these <unk> as the " highest " form of <unk> and compared them to <unk> , which he considered the highest form of reptiles . He also noted the large <unk> of the <unk> ( a unit of rocks that dates to the Late <unk> ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the <unk> and <unk> , which are Late <unk> in age . Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a <unk> progression from early amphibians ( what he called " <unk> fishes " ) . 
 In addition to <unk> , some of the earliest named genera included <unk> and <unk> in 1842 , <unk> in 1848 , <unk> in 1849 , <unk> and <unk> in 1853 , <unk> in 1858 , and <unk> in 1859 . <unk> is now placed as an early <unk> outside <unk> , and <unk> is now considered a <unk> reptile . 
 Later in the 19th century , <unk> were classified as various members of <unk> , a name coined by American paleontologist Edward <unk> Cope in 1868 . Cope placed <unk> in the class <unk> , the name then used for <unk> . <unk> means " roof @-@ headed " in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of <unk> and other early <unk> . During this time , <unk> considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for <unk> glands . 
 Several <unk> of <unk> were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> , but some were classified in the <unk> . <unk> were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while <unk> were larger and had complex , folded <unk> and enamel in their teeth . <unk> included only a few forms , such as <unk> from Europe and <unk> from North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some skeletons of <unk> were later found with long ribs , prompting its <unk> to <unk> ( although more detailed studies found it to be a <unk> ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found in many well @-@ preserved <unk> fossils from Germany . In the early 20th century , <unk> would be recognized as <unk> forms of <unk> lacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group . 
 Other animals that would later be classified as <unk> were placed in a group called <unk> , characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @-@ like scales , and <unk> arches . Unlike <unk> , they did not have parietal <unk> , small holes in their skulls behind their eye <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of <unk> . Their <unk> vertebrae , <unk> , and lack of <unk> <unk> ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as <unk> . 
 Another group called <unk> was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . Among them were <unk> , once placed in <unk> . <unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians . 
 By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded as <unk> were placed in the suborder <unk> . American paleontologist <unk> <unk> Case called it <unk> <unk> or " true <unk> " . The names <unk> and <unk> were used <unk> to refer to the order in which it belonged . The <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , both of which contain <unk> , were distinct from <unk> . Within <unk> were the groups <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Members of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , had <unk> vertebrae with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk> . <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , had lost their <unk> , and the <unk> made up the entire body of the vertebrae . <unk> had <unk> and <unk> that were of equal size . <unk> are now identified as <unk> distantly related to <unk> . 
 In 1888 , von <unk> divided <unk> among three taxa : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . He placed <unk> in <unk> , a group which he characterized as having simple , <unk> @-@ shaped <unk> <unk> . <unk> included forms with the <unk> divided into <unk> and <unk> . All members of <unk> had <unk> <unk> composed only of the <unk> . Cope objected to von <unk> 's classification , considering the vertebrae of <unk> and <unk> indistinguishable because each had a simple <unk> shape . He continued to use <unk> and <unk> ( which he alternatively referred to as <unk> ) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> became a commonly used name at the turn of the century . <unk> included both <unk> and <unk> in the group . Cope 's <unk> and <unk> fell out of use . In 1919 , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae . <unk> forms in the <unk> graded into <unk> forms in the <unk> , and finally into <unk> in the <unk> . More importantly , Watson began using the term <unk> to refer to these groups . The name <unk> was rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish paleontologist <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group , narrowing its scope to <unk> and <unk> . His classification of <unk> was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae . 
 American paleontologist Alfred <unk> brought the name <unk> back into use in the later 20th century . <unk> @-@ <unk> used the name <unk> in a strict sense ( <unk> <unk> ) to refer to <unk> and <unk> , excluding <unk> . <unk> agreed with this classification , but used the name <unk> to avoid confusion with <unk> in its wider sense ( <unk> <unk> ) . Unlike modern <unk> classification , however , <unk> included the primitive <unk> in the group .

 = = = <unk> and Early <unk> = = = 
 
 <unk> first appeared in the Early <unk> around 330 million years ago ( <unk> ) . During the <unk> , <unk> included basal medium @-@ sized forms such as <unk> or large <unk> forms such as <unk> . Other , more derived <unk> , such as the <unk> , were smaller and more terrestrial . They resembled <unk> , and some taxa , such as the genus <unk> , even retained external gills like the modern @-@ day <unk> . During the latest <unk> and Early <unk> around 300 <unk> , several groups , such as the <unk> and <unk> evolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the <unk> , developed into large <unk> predators . The <unk> , a group of small aquatic <unk> , evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late <unk> . 
 
 = = = Late <unk> = = = 
 
 During the Late <unk> , increasing <unk> and the <unk> of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial <unk> , but <unk> and fully aquatic <unk> continued to <unk> , including the large <unk> of Eastern Europe . Other <unk> , such as <unk> , developed long <unk> and a close similarity to <unk> , although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group . These <unk> included the largest known amphibian , the 9 @-@ m @-@ long <unk> of Brazil . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 As <unk> continued to <unk> and <unk> in the Late <unk> ( 260 @.@ 4 - 251 @.@ 0 <unk> ) , a major group called <unk> became more dependent on life in the water . The vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . During the <unk> period , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . During the Early <unk> ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 <unk> ) one group of successful long @-@ <unk> fish @-@ <unk> , the <unk> , even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab @-@ eating frog . Another group , the <unk> , included <unk> and large @-@ sized animals 2 @.@ 3 to 4 m ( 7 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) in length , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as <unk> . These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators , catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals . 
 In the <unk> stage of the Late <unk> ( 228 @.@ 0 - 216 @.@ 5 <unk> ) , <unk> were joined by the superficially very similar <unk> . <unk> are distinguished from <unk> by the positioning of their eye <unk> near the front of their skulls . Another group of <unk> , the <unk> , had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers . By this time , <unk> had become a common and widespread component of <unk> ecosystems . Some <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , even inhabited Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time . 
 <unk> <unk> were often the dominant <unk> animals in their environments . Large <unk> of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk> . 
 The <unk> @-@ Jurassic extinction event around 199 @.@ 6 <unk> led to the extinction of most <unk> <unk> . The <unk> survived , as well as a few <unk> and <unk> . While the latter two groups soon became extinct , <unk> persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic . Among <unk> , the <unk> flourished in China and the <unk> became common in <unk> . The most recent known <unk> was the giant <unk> <unk> , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for <unk> that normally would have competed with them . <unk> was one of the largest of the <unk> , with an estimated weight of 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . 
 
 = = Classification = = 
 
 Originally , <unk> were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder <unk> , and large <unk> aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder <unk> . With the recent growth of <unk> , this classification is no longer viable . The basic <unk> condition is found in many primitive <unk> , and is not unique to one group of <unk> . Moreover , the distinction between <unk> and <unk> vertebrae is not entirely clear . Some <unk> have <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vertebrae at different points in the same <unk> column . Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category . <unk> is no longer recognized as a group , but <unk> is still considered valid .

 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 
 In one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group , <unk> ( 1983 ) recognized five characteristics that made <unk> a clade : a bone at the back of the skull , the <unk> , is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull , the <unk> ; large openings called <unk> <unk> are present between the <unk> ; the <unk> ( a bone involved in hearing ) is connected to the <unk> and projects upward ; the <unk> , a bone in the pectoral <unk> , is thin ; and part of the <unk> called the <unk> <unk> to the neural arch . Additional features were given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the <unk> and <unk> at the back of the skull , small projections ( <unk> processes ) on the ribs , and a pelvic <unk> with each side having a single <unk> blade . These shared characteristics are called <unk> . 
 <unk> are placed as basal <unk> in phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphibians , they are either included in the crown group <unk> or the stem of <unk> . Crown @-@ group <unk> are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living <unk> and stem <unk> are forms that are outside the crown group . Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of <unk> , which would place them within crown <unk> . Below is a cladogram from <unk> et al . ( 2003 ) placing <unk> within crown <unk> : 
 Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal position within the stem of <unk> . Below is a cladogram from <unk> and <unk> ( 1999 ) placing <unk> outside crown <unk> : 
 Most phylogenetic analyses of <unk> interrelationships focus on individual families . One of the first broad @-@ scale studies of <unk> phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew <unk> in 1990 . A 2007 study made a " <unk> " of all <unk> families , combining the family @-@ level trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified from <unk> et al . ( 2007 ) : 
 1 <unk> , 2 <unk> , 3 <unk> , 4 <unk> , 5 <unk> , 6 <unk> , 7 <unk> , 8 <unk> , 9 <unk> , 10 <unk> , 11 <unk> , 12 <unk> , 13 <unk> , 14 <unk> 
 The most basal group of <unk> is the superfamily <unk> . <unk> have several primitive or <unk> features , including a single <unk> <unk> and a bone called the <unk> that is absent in other <unk> . <unk> include the Late <unk> genus <unk> and the family <unk> . <unk> has also been included in <unk> , and is the oldest known <unk> family . <unk> <unk> is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during the <unk> stage of the Early <unk> . Recent analyses place <unk> outside <unk> in a more derived position . Other primitive <unk> include <unk> and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> , both described in 2005 from <unk> , are also primitive yet come from the Late <unk> . They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal <unk> , implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record . 
 In 2000 , paleontologists Adam <unk> and Anne Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived <unk> , naming several new clades . Two major clades were <unk> and <unk> . <unk> includes the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two subfamilies , the <unk> and the <unk> . <unk> include small , mostly terrestrial <unk> that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians . <unk> include larger <unk> like <unk> . The second major clade , <unk> , includes most <unk> <unk> , as well as some <unk> groups . Within <unk> are the superfamily <unk> and the most derived <unk> , the <unk> . 
 <unk> and Warren also named <unk> , a clade of small aquatic <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . They placed <unk> within <unk> , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than <unk> , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal <unk> . 
 Within <unk> , <unk> and Warren erected two major clades : <unk> and <unk> . <unk> include large <unk> <unk> like <unk> with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull . <unk> include a diversity of <unk> , including large marine <unk> , aquatic <unk> , <unk> that survived into the Cretaceous , and <unk> with eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , paleontologists <unk> <unk> and Andrew <unk> named a third major clade of <unk> , the <unk> . This group included more primitive <unk> that could not be placed in either <unk> or <unk> , and included groups like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . While <unk> and <unk> are still widely used , <unk> is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses . <unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> , but <unk> are still considered to be a primitive family of <unk> . 
 A new phylogeny of <unk> was offered by paleontologist <unk> <unk> in 2013 . It supported many of the clades that were found by <unk> and Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk> . <unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than to <unk> , which were grouped with <unk> . The clade including <unk> and <unk> was named <unk> . In addition , <unk> named the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and reinstated the name <unk> for the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> and <unk> . Below is the cladogram from <unk> 's analysis : 
 
 = = = Relationship to modern amphibians = = = 
 
 Modern amphibians ( frogs , <unk> , and <unk> ) are classified in <unk> . <unk> appear to have arisen in the <unk> . Molecular clock estimates place the first <unk> in the Late <unk> , but the first member of <unk> ( frogs and <unk> , but not <unk> ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle <unk> using the same technique . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians . 
 One is that they evolved from <unk> <unk> . Another is that they evolved from <unk> , most likely the <unk> . A third hypothesis is that <unk> descended from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolved from <unk> . 
 Recently , the theory that <unk> were the ancestors of all <unk> has gained wide support . The skull morphology of some small <unk> has been compared to those of modern frogs and <unk> , but the presence of <unk> , <unk> teeth in small , <unk> or immature <unk> has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the <unk> origin of <unk> . <unk> in <unk> and many <unk> <unk> , <unk> teeth have <unk> tips and bases . During the development of most <unk> , teeth begin to <unk> at their tips . <unk> normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth , but <unk> from the tip stops abruptly in <unk> teeth . <unk> resumes at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth <unk> . This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils . 
 The <unk> family <unk> is thought to be most closely related to <unk> . In 2008 , an <unk> called <unk> <unk> was named from Texas and was nicknamed the " <unk> " for its frog @-@ like head and <unk> @-@ like body . It was thought to be the most closely related <unk> to <unk> and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . Another species of <unk> called <unk> <unk> is now thought to be even more closely related to <unk> . Unlike <unk> , <unk> was known since 1969 , and the presence of <unk> teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians . It was first described as a " <unk> " , and the specific name <unk> means " connecting " in reference to its inferred transitional position between <unk> and <unk> . The structure of its <unk> , a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of <unk> than is <unk> . Below is a cladogram modified from <unk> and <unk> ( 2010 ) showing the relationships of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> : 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 
 Although the earliest <unk> were primarily <unk> , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , <unk> and <unk> , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Some <unk> became better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquatic <unk> were <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding . 
 Most aquatic <unk> have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the <unk> <unk> is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . <unk> is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the <unk> of the <unk> @-@ <unk> joint between the <unk> <unk> of the skull and the <unk> <unk> of the neck . As the skull is raised , the <unk> bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to <unk> outward . Other <unk> probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . <unk> Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in <unk> . He envisioned that <unk> , a much larger <unk> than <unk> , was able to make the same movement . <unk> <unk> <unk> also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that <unk> also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral <unk> . <unk> , a close relative of <unk> , also has a <unk> skeleton that muscles may have attached to . <unk> has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could <unk> feed by rapidly opening its mouth . 
 Unlike <unk> <unk> , terrestrial <unk> have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey . The <unk> between the bones of the skull in the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree of compression . <unk> forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey . Earlier aquatic <unk> and <unk> ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during <unk> feeding underwater . <unk> like <unk> were among the first <unk> that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting . 
 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 
 <unk> , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most <unk> probably reproduced through external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female <unk> would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to <unk> them . Several fossils were described from the Early <unk> of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of <unk> <unk> . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably <unk> membranes and <unk> @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely <unk> coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these <unk> laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The <unk> membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack <unk> ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from <unk> because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . 
 One <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , may have <unk> young in an area between the gills called the <unk> <unk> . Small bones belonging to younger <unk> individuals have been found in these pouches . The living Darwin 's Frog is also a mouth <unk> and would be the closest modern <unk> to <unk> if it cared for its young in this way . An alternative possibility is that <unk> was <unk> , eating its young like many amphibians do today . If this was the case , the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the <unk> <unk> as the animal <unk> . 
 Body impressions of Early <unk> <unk> from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial <unk> mated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the <unk> were gregarious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern <unk> . 
 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 
 While most types of <unk> are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens , several are known from juvenile and <unk> specimens . <unk> is seen in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land . Several types of <unk> do not fully <unk> , but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as <unk> . <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were also <unk> because they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens . 
 <unk> larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a <unk> apparatus , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have external gills . A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occur in <unk> , including the <unk> and strengthening of skull bones , the <unk> of <unk> bones , and an increase in body size . 
 <unk> like <unk> are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change in body shape . In these species , the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development . The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time . Small , regularly spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As development continues , the external gills disappear . Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . The <unk> skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull , with ossification ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . <unk> and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages , and the <unk> and <unk> are entirely absent through most of development . Once maturity is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows . The bones of some <unk> like <unk> show growth marks , possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons . <unk> of <unk> like <unk> and <unk> show that individuals grew larger past maturity . The oldest individuals usually have more <unk> on their skulls with deeper <unk> . 
 One group of <unk> , the <unk> , is also known from <unk> specimens . <unk> like <unk> and <unk> are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens , but the lack of <unk> adapted adult forms suggests that these <unk> were <unk> . Unlike other <unk> , their <unk> skeletons developed quickly but were still partly <unk> when fully mature . Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . Recently , large specimens of <unk> <unk> were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all <unk> were <unk> . 
 While most <unk> are aquatic in early stages of life , most <unk> appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage . Like other <unk> <unk> , adult <unk> were adapted to a <unk> lifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross @-@ <unk> thickness of limb bones in adult <unk> shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial <unk> . <unk> individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress , and could probably move about on land . To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a <unk> 's limb bones would have to <unk> with positive <unk> , meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in <unk> , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle .

 <unk> and other early <unk> have rounded <unk> <unk> in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , the <unk> notch would have been covered by a membrane called the <unk> , which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs . The <unk> is involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced <unk> . It was traditionally thought that the <unk> developed very early in <unk> evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of <unk> . Thus , <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles . 
 <unk> and all other living <unk> have a rod @-@ like bone called the <unk> that aids in hearing by transferring <unk> from the ear drum — or <unk> <unk> — to the inner ear . <unk> also have a <unk> , which projects into the <unk> cavity . The <unk> likely evolved from the <unk> of lobe @-@ <unk> fishes . The positioning of the <unk> and the shape of the <unk> region suggests that the <unk> of <unk> and frogs are <unk> , but the <unk> of these amphibians are no longer considered <unk> with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in <unk> were not ancestral to those of all other <unk> . 
 The ability of the <unk> and <unk> to effectively transmit <unk> is called <unk> matching . Early <unk> like <unk> have thick <unk> with poor <unk> matching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thick <unk> may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the <unk> notch . Early <unk> like <unk> could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Later <unk> like <unk> had <unk> regions adapted to hearing . <unk> has a structure in the inner ear called the <unk> <unk> , which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing . Its <unk> is also a better <unk> of sound . The hearing system of <unk> and related <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians .

 <unk> de Bayeux ( <unk> 1121 to <unk> ) was a medieval English <unk> and archdeacon in the Diocese of York . A relative of <unk> , the Archbishop of York , <unk> probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . After <unk> 's death , <unk> was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric , William <unk> , and worked to secure <unk> 's deposition and replacement by Henry <unk> . After <unk> 's death in <unk> , <unk> tried to prevent the return of <unk> , but these attempts were unsuccessful . When <unk> died suddenly in 1154 , <unk> was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop . Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped of his clerical status and became a <unk> before <unk> . He died after <unk> , perhaps even after 1194 .

 <unk> was first mentioned in the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter , which although likely a forgery , probably contains an authentic witness list .

He was the nephew of <unk> , who was Archbishop of York from <unk> to 1140 . <unk> he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age .

In <unk> , <unk> deposed <unk> 's choice as abbot of <unk> and appointed another abbot . Originally , <unk> had supported Elias <unk> , <unk> 's choice for abbot , but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition . 
 After <unk> 's death in <unk> , <unk> was opposed to William 's return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent William 's <unk> .

 <unk> was accused of murdering William , specifically by poisoning him through the communion <unk> .

A trial was finally held in <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> did not produce any witnesses , but <unk> was unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court . No record of any judgment exists , but <unk> apparently appeared before two <unk> , Adrian IV and Alexander III . A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges @-@ delegate between 1175 and 1180 . 
 The case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . John of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added information about <unk> in a letter to Alexander III on unrelated business . In the section of the letter , John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about <unk> , he had failed to secure other clergy willing to <unk> that he was innocent . Another contemporary , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of Hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although <unk> 's <unk> had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal .

 <unk> had two sons , William de Bayeux and <unk> de <unk> . <unk> was a benefactor to a number of monasteries , including Drax Priory , <unk> Priory and <unk> Priory . He also gave land to a hospital in York and to the Templars and Hospitallers . 
 
 
 = Dvorak technique = 
 
 The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone <unk> ) based solely on visible and infrared satellite images . Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns used are curved band pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central dense <unk> ( <unk> ) pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central cold cover ( <unk> ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and eye pattern ( <unk> - <unk> ) . 
 Both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern use the size of the <unk> . The <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape of the central dense <unk> is also considered . The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number . The <unk> pattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature . 
 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> Branch ( <unk> ) , the <unk> / <unk> <unk> Analysis Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Meteorology and <unk> Command in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . 
 
 = = Evolution of the method = = 
 
 The initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean . The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model . As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area . Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself . <unk> on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 hPa ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @.@ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwest Pacific . This led to the development of a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , devised by Atkinson and Holliday in 1975 , then modified in 1977 . 
 As human analysts using the technique lead to <unk> biases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers . Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can <unk> over time , automated techniques use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength ) . It still required a manual center placement , keeping some <unk> within the process . By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to <unk> determine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the <unk> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique . 
 
 = = Details of the method = = 
 
 In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . In each case a " T @-@ number " ( an abbreviation for Tropical Number ) and a Current <unk> ( <unk> ) value are assigned to the storm . These measurements range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum intensity ) . The T @-@ number and <unk> value are the same except for weakening storms , in which case the <unk> is higher . For weakening systems , the <unk> is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours , though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T @-@ number . The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 ‑ hour period is limited to 2 @.@ 5 T @-@ numbers per day .

Both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the <unk> . The <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) ) . The shape of the central dense <unk> is also considered . The farther the center is <unk> into the <unk> , the stronger it is deemed . Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of <unk> obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge . 
 The <unk> pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thick <unk> clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the circulation center . While it resembles a <unk> pattern , it is rarely seen . 
 The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the <unk> using rapid scan <unk> satellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour . 
 Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number .

 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors . These include the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> Branch ( <unk> ) , the National <unk> and <unk> Administration 's <unk> Analysis Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Pacific Meteorology and <unk> Center in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . 
 The National Hurricane Center will often quote Dvorak T @-@ numbers in their tropical cyclone products . The following example is from discussion number 3 of Tropical Depression 24 ( eventually Hurricane <unk> ) of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> IN <unk> A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / 35 <unk> . <unk> ... <unk> THE <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 12 <unk> <unk> THE <unk> <unk> . <unk> ... THE <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 30 <unk> . 
 Note that in this case the Dvorak T @-@ number ( in this case <unk> ) was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the NHC decided to set the system 's intensity . 
 The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological <unk> Studies ( <unk> ) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed the <unk> Dvorak <unk> ( <unk> ) . This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than <unk> human interpretation to arrive at a <unk> number . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China Meteorological Agency ( <unk> ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian Meteorological Department ( <unk> ) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .

 The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available . <unk> estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time , though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical @-@ storm force ( 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) ) and weak <unk> or typhoon @-@ force ( 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) ) is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , as <unk> in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . The method is internally consistent in that it <unk> rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclones <unk> in strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polar @-@ orbiting satellite imagery . Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the development of the <unk> @-@ <unk> technique in 1975 . <unk> undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their <unk> underestimated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the development of the Miller and <unk> extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances .

 <unk> <unk> <unk> is an <unk> @-@ speaking Indigenous Australian , born around 1945 or 1953 at the Santa Teresa Mission , near Alice Springs in Australia 's Northern Territory . 
 When <unk> <unk> began painting for <unk> Gallery in central Australia , she indicated that her name was <unk> rather than <unk> , and that this was how she <unk> wished to be known ; however <unk> 's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name . 
 After marrying Robin <unk> , brother of artist Gloria <unk> , <unk> <unk> moved to the region of <unk> , north @-@ east of Alice Springs , which is where she was living when she began painting around 1990 . They had seven children , one of whom , <unk> <unk> , went on to become an artist like his mother .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at <unk> created murals and <unk> using western art materials , assisted by teacher Geoffrey <unk> . Their work , which used <unk> paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly after the introduction of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the <unk> <unk> artists ' company , were men , and there was resistance among the <unk> men of central Australia to women also painting . However , many of the women wished to participate , and in the 1990s many of them began to paint . In the western desert communities such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on the <unk> , people were beginning to create art works <unk> for exhibition and sale .

 <unk> <unk> began painting about 1990 or 1992 as part of the contemporary Indigenous art movement that had begun at <unk> in the 1970s . By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions , such as Charles Sturt University , and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria . Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria 's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue ; her painting was printed opposite that of <unk> Tommy Watson , who was by this time famous , particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du <unk> <unk> . <unk> 's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong , as well as at the Australian embassy in Washington in 2001 .

 Central Australian artists frequently paint particular " <unk> " , or stories , for which they have responsibility or rights . These stories are used to pass " important knowledge , cultural values and belief systems " from generation to generation . <unk> by <unk> portray two different groups of <unk> , rendered in two distinct styles . Bush plum dreaming represents a plant of the central Australian desert which is " a source of physical and spiritual sustenance , reminding [ the local Indigenous people ] of the <unk> of [ their ] country " . These paintings are undertaken with red , blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development . She also paints women ’ s ceremonies ( <unk> ) and <unk> , and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women 's ceremonial iconography . 
 Journalist <unk> <unk> described <unk> as one of the " finest contemporary Aboriginal artists " . Art consultant Adrian Newstead has ranked her as amongst the country 's top 200 Indigenous artists , noting that she has become " known for innovative works that create a sense of visual harmony through fine <unk> fields of <unk> applied <unk> " .

 = Head VI = 
 
 Head VI is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas painting by the Irish @-@ born English <unk> artist Francis <unk> , the last of six panels making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego <unk> 's Portrait of Innocent X. <unk> applies forceful , expressive brush <unk> , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @-@ like <unk> . This gives the effect of a man trapped and <unk> by his surroundings , screaming into an <unk> void . 
 Head VI was the first of <unk> 's paintings to reference <unk> , whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of " screaming <unk> " , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in <unk> 's work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain <unk> , can be found even in his late paintings . The <unk> cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , Study for a Self @-@ Portrait — <unk> . 
 Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London , in a showing organised by one of the artist 's early champions , Erica <unk> . At the time , <unk> was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a <unk> , which made him the <unk> terrible of British art . Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John Russell , later <unk> 's biographer , at the time dismissed it as a cross between " an <unk> <unk> of its jaws and an <unk> in <unk> @-@ <unk> who has come to a bad end " . In 1989 Lawrence <unk> wrote that the " shock of the picture , when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable . It was everything <unk> . The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and <unk> was indeed one of <unk> 's most original <unk> . " Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from <unk> 's unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one of <unk> 's finest <unk> .

 <unk> 's output is characterised by sequences of images . He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that " images breed other images in me " . His series were not always planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he returned <unk> , late in 1948 , from a stay in <unk> . In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting ( 1946 ) . Although he continued to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , given to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 . <unk> Erica <unk> offered <unk> the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery . He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to hang . In following years , <unk> became perhaps the most important of <unk> 's early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised <unk> for international <unk> . 
 Already 40 years old , <unk> viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition , completing the series barely in time for the opening . 
 The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are <unk> , overwhelmingly <unk> , <unk> and eerie . Coming early in <unk> 's career , they are uneven in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how they <unk> and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . Head I ( actually begun in the winter of 1948 ) and Head II show <unk> pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have half @-@ open eyes and a <unk> , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human . Heads III , IV and V show fully formed <unk> recognisable as men , and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere . These two broad ideas <unk> in Head VI , which is as <unk> tortured as the first two paintings , and as spectral as the middle three . In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments , the first indication in <unk> 's work of the influence of <unk> , while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream . 
 <unk> said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in <unk> <unk> and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous <unk> and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . " He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would <unk> mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit <unk> . " This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather <unk> study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of <unk> masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to <unk> <unk> for the subsequent 20 years . 
 The series marks <unk> 's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , <unk> , and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these circumstances all <unk> falls away , and the social being becomes the sum of its <unk> , which <unk> attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . According to Russell , " the view out front ceases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly <unk> , fragmented , and subject to strange <unk> . " Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . This <unk> is abandoned in <unk> 's series . 
 Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II . Although it is well @-@ regarded critically , Head II is seen as something of a creative <unk> @-@ de @-@ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI . It is exceptional in <unk> 's <unk> that works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was <unk> self @-@ critical and often <unk> or abandoned <unk> before they were completed . When pressed again by <unk> in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been <unk> for a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other <unk> . 
 <unk> commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for which <unk> painted three large <unk> modelled on <unk> 's portrait . The gallery advertised the show as " Francis <unk> : Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by <unk> " , but in the end <unk> was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened .

 The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a " space @-@ frame " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . A <unk> hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . It is too <unk> drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in <unk> 's later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the <unk> of a curtain ; the hanging <unk> was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a <unk> function , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 <unk> , May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . For <unk> , these elements were intended to make the figure <unk> in and out of sight for the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , <unk> open or closed . 
 The figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an expression <unk> took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in <unk> <unk> 's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship <unk> . In 1984 , the broadcaster <unk> Bragg asked <unk> about the still , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the <unk> of the human mouth . <unk> replied , " I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a <unk> landscape though I never succeeded in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed , <unk> said , " It should be all much more colour , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn 't happen to get it . " His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of <unk> oral cavities bought in a second @-@ hand <unk> , kept in his studio and to which he often referred to . 
 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence . <unk> later in life , <unk> said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful " . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as <unk> photographs of Adolf <unk> 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage . <unk> strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and " really see the image – for no other reason . I know it 's been interpreted as being many other things . " Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio <unk> of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending <unk> . Denis Farr notes that <unk> was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to <unk> " shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an <unk> . "

 The so @-@ called " space frame " had already been used by Alberto <unk> in the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s . However <unk> had by 1949 used it only in <unk> contexts before <unk> 's <unk> , and in turn influenced his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore 's works , notably his " <unk> for King and Queen " , constructed three years after <unk> 's Head . It is difficult to <unk> how these artists influenced and informed each other . What is notable is that <unk> continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back . 
 The full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted in heavy brush <unk> are in part influenced by <unk> but also similar to <unk> 's 1558 Portrait of Cardinal Filippo <unk> . <unk> <unk> the Old Master 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer ; the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more affecting . <unk> had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel , and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially in his " screaming <unk> " . He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many reproductions of works by <unk> and <unk> in which it is employed . He had begun his career as an interior <unk> and designer of furniture and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s , and later said that he liked " rooms hung all round with just <unk> hung in even folds " . <unk> or <unk> appear in <unk> 's earliest works , notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body , always in portraits and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure . 
 Head VI is closely modelled on <unk> 's c . 1650 Portrait of Innocent X , today in the <unk> <unk> Gallery , Rome . <unk> cautiously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination . Yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants of it <unk> for almost two decades ; an examination and homage described as " without parallel in the history of art " . <unk> 's approach differs to <unk> 's in a number of ways : both artists were expressive , yet <unk> 's broad brush @-@ <unk> and freedom with paint contrast with <unk> 's tight and controlled treatment . He <unk> <unk> 's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer 's point of view , elevating and <unk> him . This was already a common technique in commercial , promotional photography but in <unk> 's hands , <unk> argues , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to <unk> observe . 
 Although <unk> revered <unk> 's portrait , he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting . In interviews , he said that he saw flaws in <unk> 's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian <unk> <unk> , " obsolete and decayed " . <unk> 's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , thereby making a <unk> comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting . Yet <unk> 's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting . The sitter 's pose closely echoes the original , as does the violet and white colouring of his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush @-@ <unk> . The influence can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure . Art historian <unk> <unk> describes the work as a mixture of <unk> and subversion that pays tribute to <unk> , while at the same time <unk> his painting . 
 Sylvester <unk> the influence of late works by <unk> in other aspects , especially in the deep and rich colouring , <unk> 's portrayals of Philip IV , and agrees with identification of <unk> of Edgar <unk> as a source . He believes <unk> borrowed from <unk> the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what <unk> described as " <unk> " , as seen in the earlier artist 's After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in <unk> 's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo <unk> . He believes the folds serve to " push the viewer back " , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes them as an <unk> of background <unk> into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter . In his " <unk> with Francis <unk> " series of books , he asked <unk> why he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , " Well , it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you but <unk> slowly and gently through the gaps . " 
 When asked why he was compelled to revisit the <unk> so often , <unk> replied that he had nothing against <unk> per <unk> , but merely sought " an excuse to use these colours , and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false <unk> manner . " <unk> sees Head VI as a reaction against <unk> , and a commentary on how the papacy is " obsolete and decayed " , with a pope resistant to both modernisation and <unk> . To him , the figure seems to " resist the <unk> of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order . He screams and <unk> , clutching at arms of his throne . " Sylvester notes that <unk> was impressed by Picasso 's <unk> and handling of paint , especially in Picasso 's 1930s works ; and suggests that the white <unk> around the pope 's <unk> may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a <unk> <unk> in an <unk> .

 When <unk> undertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a two @-@ hit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a <unk> and to a lesser extent with Painting ( 1946 ) , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as <unk> . The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional <unk> . The full show established him in the minds of critics as , according to Michael <unk> , " more of a force to be <unk> with in the contemporary scene " . While some found his images <unk> and <unk> , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the <unk> terrible of post @-@ war British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , " The recent paintings ... <unk> as they are , cannot be ignored . Technically they are superb , and the masterly handling of large areas of <unk> grey , flushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric " . 
 Most critics focused on Heads I and VI , remarking favourably on the progression between the two . While some found the inherent violence of the paintings <unk> , <unk> was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought <unk> 's work to national attention . <unk> notes that the exhibition showed <unk> no longer needed <unk> material to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought , by presenting his sitter " in a <unk> setting , a cage or [ behind ] a parted <unk> ... the rest , the most essential , lay in the manipulation of the infinitely <unk> medium of oil paint " . After the showing <unk> gradually became " less the <unk> with an occasional image of <unk> <unk> and more a force to be <unk> with on the contemporary scene " . His reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought after by European , American and African collectors and galleries , commanding prices as high as £ 400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time .

 Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery , London , in 1949 . It was acquired by the Arts Council 's <unk> Gallery in 1952 . The <unk> has loaned it out a number of times since , including for major <unk> at the Grand <unk> , Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh Lane Gallery , Dublin , in 2000 . 
 In May 1996 , the National Gallery took on loan <unk> 's Innocent X portrait and hung it alongside four <unk> paintings ; Head VI , Pope I ( 1951 ) , Pope 1961 and Pope 1965 . <unk> believes that <unk> would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power " .

 <unk> was a movement in early 20th @-@ century Anglo @-@ American poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear , sharp language . 
 <unk> has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre @-@ <unk> . As a poetic style it gave <unk> its start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized <unk> literary movement in the English language . <unk> is sometimes viewed as ' a succession of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development . René <unk> remarked that ' It is more accurate to consider <unk> not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles ' . 
 The <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , <unk> called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such as <unk> of presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . <unk> use free verse . 
 <unk> publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures , both in poetry and in other fields . The <unk> group was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . <unk> unusually for the time , a number of women writers were major <unk> figures . 
 A characteristic feature of <unk> is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @-@ garde art , especially <unk> . Although <unk> <unk> objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called " luminous details " , Pound 's <unk> Method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner of <unk> multiple perspectives into a single image .

 Well @-@ known poets of the <unk> era of the 1890s , such as Alfred Austin , Stephen Phillips , and William Watson , had been working very much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era . They continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate , a post which he held up to 1913 . In the century 's first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy 's The <unk> , Christina <unk> 's posthumous <unk> Works , Ernest <unk> 's Poems , George Meredith 's Last Poems , Robert Service 's <unk> of a <unk> and John <unk> 's <unk> and Poems . Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was <unk> much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to <unk> Kipling . 
 The origins of <unk> are to be found in two poems , Autumn and A City Sunset by T. E. <unk> . These were published in January 1909 by the Poets ' Club in London in a booklet called For Christmas <unk> . <unk> was a student of mathematics and philosophy ; he had been involved in the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary . Around the end of 1908 , he presented his paper A <unk> on Modern Poetry at one of the club 's meetings . Writing in A. R. <unk> 's magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint ( a champion of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly critical of the club and its publications . From the ensuing debate , <unk> and Flint became close friends . In 1909 , <unk> left the Poets ' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which <unk> referred to as the " <unk> Club " ; they met at the <unk> Tower restaurant in London 's <unk> to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the <unk> and <unk> and the removal of all unnecessary <unk> from poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late Victorian and <unk> revival of interest in <unk> and <unk> as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson 's Japanese prints donated to the British Museum , performances of <unk> plays in London , and the success of Gilbert and Sullivan 's <unk> The <unk> ( 1885 ) . Direct literary models were available from a number of sources , including F. V. <unk> 's 1866 <unk> <unk> is <unk> , or , <unk> by a Century of Poets , Being Japanese <unk> Odes , the first English @-@ language version of the <unk> <unk> , a 13th @-@ century anthology of 100 <unk> , the early 20th @-@ century critical writings and poems of <unk> Hartmann , and contemporary French @-@ language translations . 
 The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own . In particular , Pound 's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the <unk> , direct expression that he detected in the writings of <unk> Daniel , Dante , and <unk> <unk> , amongst others . For example , in his 1911 – 12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris , Pound writes of Daniel 's line " <unk> de <unk> m <unk> <unk> " ( " it rests me to think of her " ) ( from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 'l <unk> <unk> ) : " You cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer , or less <unk> " . These criteria of <unk> , clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of <unk> poetry . Through his friendship with Laurence <unk> , Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining <unk> @-@ e prints at the British Museum , and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms . 
 In an article in La France , 1915 , the French critic , <unk> de <unk> described the <unk> as descendants of the French <unk> and in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René <unk> , Pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for <unk> , pointing out that <unk> was indebted to a <unk> tradition , linking back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur Symons and the <unk> ' Club generation of British poets to <unk> and the <unk> source was amplified further in <unk> 's study published in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language ' between the image of the <unk> and the ' symbol ' of the <unk> there is a difference only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet , Lionel Johnson for the publisher <unk> Mathews . In his introduction , he wrote

 In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the <unk> Tower group : his former fiancée Hilda <unk> ( who had started signing her work <unk> ) and her future husband Richard <unk> . These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially <unk> , an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto @-@ <unk> interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound told <unk> and <unk> that they were <unk> and even <unk> the signature <unk> <unk> to some poems they were discussing . 
 When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submitted <unk> three poems each by <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> <unk> , ( published in the November 1912 second issue <unk> ) with a note which described <unk> as ' one of the ' <unk> ' . This note , along with the <unk> note ( ' The Complete Works of T. S. <unk> ' ) in Pound 's book ( also published in Autumn 1912 ) entitled <unk> are considered to be first appearances of the word <unk> ( later <unk> to ' <unk> ' ) in print . 
 <unk> 's poems , <unk> , To a Greek <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , were in the November issue of Poetry , and <unk> ' s , Hermes of the Ways , <unk> , and <unk> , appeared in the January 1913 issue ; <unk> as a movement was launched . Poetry 's April issue published what came to be seen as " <unk> 's enabling text " , the <unk> @-@ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled " In a Station of the Metro " : 
 The <unk> of these faces in the crowd ; 
 <unk> on a wet , black <unk> . 
 The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don <unk> by an <unk> and the essay entitled <unk> both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained this <unk> statement of the group 's position : 
 Direct treatment of the " thing " , whether <unk> or objective . 
 To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation . 
 As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the <unk> . 
 Pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce <unk> works " . His list of " don <unk> " reinforced his three statements in " <unk> " , while warning that they should not be considered as <unk> but as the " result of long contemplation " . Taken together , these two texts comprised the <unk> programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past . <unk> Flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . " 
 The 1916 preface to Some <unk> Poets comments " <unk> does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . <unk> refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . "

 <unk> to promote the work of the <unk> , and particularly of <unk> and <unk> , Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des <unk> . It was first published in Alfred <unk> 's little magazine The <unk> and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles <unk> in New York and by Harold <unk> at the Poetry <unk> in London . It became one of the most important and influential English @-@ language collections of modernist verse . Included in the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by <unk> , seven by <unk> , and six by Pound . The book also included work by <unk> Flint , <unk> <unk> , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , Ford <unk> Ford , Allen <unk> and John <unk> <unk> was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt The <unk> Poem Modern Poetry in miniature . 
 Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with <unk> precepts , rather than active participation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the discussions of the <unk> Tower group . However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Pre @-@ <unk> @-@ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound by <unk> Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary <unk> , as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest , of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The <unk> . Joyce 's poem is not written in free verse , but in rhyming <unk> . However , it strongly reflects Pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music , such as those by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher .

 The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of <unk> written by Flint and published in The <unk> in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the <unk> Tower poets , especially Edward <unk> . Pound , who believed that the " Hellenic hardness " that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of <unk> and <unk> was likely to be diluted by the " <unk> " of <unk> , was to play no further direct role in the history of the <unk> . He went on to co @-@ found the <unk> with his friend , the painter and writer <unk> Lewis . 
 Around this time , the American <unk> Amy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the other <unk> poets . Lowell was a wealthy <unk> from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 @-@ 1933 . She loved Keats and cigars . She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound 's <unk> editorial attitude to a more democratic manner . This new editorial policy was stated in the <unk> to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : " In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only <unk> being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . " The outcome was a series of <unk> anthologies under the title Some <unk> Poets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by <unk> and <unk> . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including <unk> poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the <unk> name from her publications and who <unk> dubbed this phase of <unk> " Amy @-@ <unk> . " 
 Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an <unk> . <unk> Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements ( <unk> , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the <unk> as a movement . 
 
 = = <unk> after <unk> = = 
 
 In 1929 , Walter <unk> <unk> suggested that <unk> should produce a new <unk> anthology . <unk> , by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and <unk> The result was the <unk> Anthology 1930 , edited by <unk> and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died , <unk> , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the <unk> in the history of 20th @-@ century poetry . 
 Of the poets who were published in the various <unk> anthologies , Joyce , Lawrence and <unk> are now primarily remembered and read as novelists . <unk> Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an <unk> concern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken " from the mouths of Polish mothers " . Both Pound and <unk> turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an <unk> legacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of <unk> . 
 
 = = Legacy = = 
 
 Despite the movement 's short life , <unk> would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English . Richard <unk> , in his 1941 memoir , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra Pound , <unk> , Lawrence , and Ford <unk> Ford will continue to be read . And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the <unk> . " 
 On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the <unk> approach : " Not all objects are equal . The vice of <unk> was that it did not recognize this . " With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later effects that are <unk> in T. S. Eliot 's ' <unk> ' and ' Morning at the Window ' and in D. H. Lawrence 's animal and flower pieces . The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> <unk> of the Georgian Poetry style . 
 The influence of <unk> can be seen clearly in the work of the <unk> poets , who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams . The <unk> worked mainly in free verse . <unk> linking <unk> 's principles with <unk> 's , Louis <unk> insisted , in his introduction to the 1931 <unk> issue of Poetry , on writing " which is the detail , not <unk> , of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of directing them along a line of melody . " <unk> was a major influence on the Language poets , who carried the <unk> focus on formal concerns to a high level of development . Basil <unk> , another <unk> poet , was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets . 
 <unk> influenced a number of poetry circles and <unk> the <unk> Free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form . In the 1950s , especially , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In his seminal 1950 essay <unk> Verse , Charles <unk> , the theorist of the Black Mountain group , wrote " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> A <unk> <unk> " ; his <unk> derived from and supplemented the <unk> . 
 Among the Beats , Gary <unk> and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by the <unk> emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg 's <unk> ( 1955 ) .

 Operation Eastern Exit was the <unk> given to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , in January 1991 . In late December 1990 , violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began <unk> with government soldiers . On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , James <unk> Bishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved the following day . United States Central Command began planning and <unk> forces that evening . The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu International Airport , but this was later abandoned . A helicopter evacuation via the USS Guam and USS <unk> was the remaining option . 
 On the morning of 5 January , a 60 @-@ person Marine and Navy <unk> security detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation . The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 <unk> . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy . Four waves of five CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January . The <unk> were transported to Muscat , Oman , where they disembarked on 11 January . In total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 In the late 1980s , there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre , a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses . By 1990 , what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war , with several militias organized to overthrow the central government . 
 In July 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) compound , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the previous embassy and James K. Bishop was appointed as the United States ' ambassador to Somalia . Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US embassies . In 1967 , he was at the US Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon when the Six @-@ Day War erupted . About 3 @,@ 600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city . As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981 – 87 , Bishop chaired several task forces for <unk> and gained experience in the State Department 's operations center as <unk> were carried out during several coups d <unk> . During his previous assignment as Ambassador to <unk> ( 1987 – 90 ) , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in <unk> spread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed to a <unk> to deal with the crisis in <unk> , which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August . 
 On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen. Norman <unk> . Ambassador Bishop , aware of the ongoing <unk> , believed " the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances . " Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and <unk> the importance of being prepared to deal with <unk> and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy 's <unk> and <unk> ( E & E ) plan until he was " satisfied ... that [ Central Command ] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that . " In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit , the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop 's previous experience and " clear understanding of his role " in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well . 
 <unk> after Ambassador Bishop 's visit to Central Command , Iraq invaded Kuwait . In 1979 , the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and <unk> ; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area , maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait . 
 An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents ( e.g. children and spouses of staff ) and non @-@ essential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress ( a rebel militia ) remained no less than about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles ( 64 km ) of Mogadishu .

 On 30 December , violence escalated " an order of magnitude " as militants entered Mogadishu , which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness . On 30 – 31 December , diplomats , including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city , were collected and housed in the embassy compound , except two volunteers who remained in the embassy 's K @-@ 7 residential apartments located across <unk> Road from the embassy . The volunteers in the K @-@ 7 building would be needed as look @-@ outs for the embassy compound 's main gate . On the morning of 31 December , the defense <unk> was nearly killed when his vehicle was <unk> with bullets and that evening , a soldier at a roadblock shot the <unk> of a vehicle carrying another defense official . Attempts by the US and other nations ' diplomats , in particular the Italian embassy , to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful . <unk> Road became a " shooting gallery , " preventing those in safe @-@ <unk> outside the embassy from reaching it . On New Year 's Day , the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy . 
 Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian , French , or German evacuation efforts , but preferred an evacuation by the US military . The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day , Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military , thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit . Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing <unk> plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts . Ultimately , ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two <unk> d <unk> — along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated . 
 
 = = Plans , <unk> , and escalating violence = = 
 
 Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's E & E plan . The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better have <unk> crowd take a look at a <unk> <unk> of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from <unk> <unk> area . " Following the ambassador 's 2 January evacuation request , the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu , and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation . 
 The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the United States Air Force deployed C @-@ 130 transport planes and an AC @-@ 130 , for gunfire support , to <unk> , Kenya , awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer <unk> from the embassy to the airport . However , the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances . It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit of <unk> to the airport . 
 On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed <unk> until the USS Guam and USS <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the <unk> . Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . The request was denied , but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning . 
 USS Guam and USS <unk> began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 Oman time ) on 2 January . The commander of <unk> Group Two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship <unk> Task Group , composed of vessels anchored at <unk> Island ( off Oman ) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation . However , intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships . Although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to <unk> caused a delay of eight to ten hours . Guam and <unk> carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade , including a detachment of CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the US military — and two squadrons of CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters . 
 Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop 's planning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 : 00 on 7 January . However , in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @,@ 050 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 940 km ; 1 @,@ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 650 km ; 1 @,@ 020 mi ) flights with the CH @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea . The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January .

 On the evening of 4 January , the final execute order was issued for a 02 : 45 launch of two CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> to arrive at the embassy at dawn . The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . Two Marine Corps <unk> @-@ 130 <unk> tankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from Bahrain to Oman , to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from <unk> to Guam .

 Two CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> carrying a 60 @-@ man security detail — 51 Marines and nine Navy <unk> — departed Guam at 02 : 47 , <unk> nautical miles ( <unk> km ; <unk> mi ) from the embassy , and were expected to arrive at 06 : 20 . They performed two aerial <unk> . During the first <unk> , a pipe burst on one of the helicopters , <unk> soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam ; problems with the helicopters ' navigation system also complicated the <unk> rendezvous . The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn , crossing the coast just south of the harbor at 25 – 50 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 – 15 @.@ 2 m ) in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city . On their arrival in Mogadishu , the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map , which showed the embassy in an isolated area . Furthermore , they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course . The embassy was , in fact , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city . The helicopters were flying too low to spot a <unk> light which was placed on the embassy 's water tower ( the highest point within the embassy compound ) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black , oil @-@ coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would <unk> breaking radio silence ( their only direct communication with the embassy was <unk> ) to contact the embassy , they were able to <unk> it and land at 07 : 10 . As they arrived , a group of about 100 to 150 <unk> were attempting to enter the embassy compound via <unk> on the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived . 
 The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force 's AC @-@ 130 arrived to provide overhead support . Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement : they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent . He also identified three zones of defense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force : 
 the entire embassy compound 
 the Chancery , Joint Administrative Office ( <unk> ) building , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone ( <unk> ) 
 the <unk> and <unk> buildings ( the two " <unk> " buildings where the <unk> were held ) 
 Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu . He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict . To this effect , he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict . The Marines who had been <unk> in fuel during the <unk> were able to take a shower and wash their clothes . 
 After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 <unk> , including all American civilians and four heads of mission . <unk> were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm . <unk> with the only in @-@ flight <unk> on the return nearly prevented <unk> , which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue . At 9 : 40 , the helicopters arrived on Guam and <unk> the <unk> . 
 
 = = = Embassy during the day = = = 
 
 No threats came upon the embassy during the day , although <unk> of armed <unk> frequently drove by the embassy along <unk> Road . Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . A sniper and a <unk> were positioned on the embassy 's water tower ( the highest structure in the compound ) and came under fire ; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower . 
 The Office of Military Cooperation , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation . Despite its proximity to the embassy , an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest . A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and <unk> left the embassy at 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the <unk> ( four Americans , a <unk> , and 17 <unk> ) . This was the only <unk> outside the embassy by the security detail . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassy <unk> to be evacuated ; the US welcomed these requests , but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy . 
 A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed to travel to rescue the German <unk> d <unk> and British ambassador ( junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy ) . The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador . 
 The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( <unk> ) , which was set up in the <unk> . A 44 @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the <unk> was planned for insertion with the CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> after they had returned to the Guam . However , this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail . The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . The <unk> were grouped into 15 @-@ person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , many <unk> had pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's <unk> , such as candy , <unk> , and souvenirs ( most had been stationed on ships for several months ) . They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the <unk> filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship . 
 As evening approached , work began to prepare the <unk> for the main evacuation . The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated . Some cars had to be broken into to be moved . Chemical lights were placed in the <unk> in a NATO " Y " pattern . The entire mission would be conducted with night vision <unk> , which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off .

 The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH @-@ 46 helicopters . The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight , which lack aerial <unk> capability ; the ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles ( 650 – 700 km ; 400 – 440 mi ) away during this phase . An AC @-@ 130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two <unk> @-@ 1 Iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support , but were not deployed . 
 The first wave departed Guam at 23 : 43 . As the second wave landed , Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two <unk> of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other . His request to speak with the ambassador was granted . Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from <unk> on the deal . The final wave departed the embassy at 1 : 49 and landed on Guam at 2 : 23 ; twenty minutes later , Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete . 
 
 = = = Aftermath at the embassy = = = 
 
 Armed <unk> were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed . The doors of the <unk> — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by <unk> within two hours of the embassy 's evacuation . Somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service <unk> ( <unk> ) — could not be evacuated . Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees <unk> to safer parts of Somalia . Many of the <unk> had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the <unk> . The Ambassador left the <unk> with keys to the <unk> and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed .

 A total of 281 <unk> were taken from the embassy , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) and 61 Americans ( including Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff ) . The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States , Kenya , Nigeria , Soviet Union , Sudan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and United Kingdom and the <unk> of the embassies of Germany , Kuwait , Oman , and <unk> . 
 Rather than disembark in nearby <unk> , as originally thought by the <unk> , the ships were ordered back to Oman — a five @-@ day journey . The sailors and marines made way for the <unk> to share living quarters . When the <unk> of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the <unk> while aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some of the sailors even dressed up as <unk> to ease the ordeal for children . At the request of the ambassadors , a formal session with the ships ' senior officers was held to express their thanks . On 11 January , the <unk> were <unk> at Muscat , Oman . That afternoon , the American <unk> were flown to Frankfurt , Germany , from where they continued home .

 The 2010 <unk> Shield was the 57th <unk> Shield tournament , the premier baseball competition in Australia , and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010 . It was hailed as the precursor to the new Australian Baseball League that will start in the place of the <unk> Shield in late 2010 to early 2011 . The Victoria <unk> defeated South Australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament ; this was the 22nd time the <unk> Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team . The competition was sponsored by <unk> 's <unk> . 
 At the conclusion of the regular season , the Victoria <unk> finished in first place with a 17 – 7 record , earning home @-@ field advantage for the three @-@ game championship series . South Australia hosted the three @-@ game semi @-@ final series against the New South Wales <unk> . Both teams finished with a 14 – 10 record . The Perth Heat ( 12 – 12 ) and Queensland <unk> ( 3 – 21 ) both failed to qualify for the finals .

 In June 2009 , it was announced that the rights to the <unk> Shield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League ( <unk> ) , with ownership split between Major League Baseball 's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural <unk> season starting in 2010 – 11 . It varied from the 2009 <unk> Shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds . Since an uneven number ( five ) teams were involved , four teams paired off for each round and played a three @-@ game series , while the remaining team took a bye . During the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team , one at home and one away . In total , the schedule allowed for 24 regular @-@ season games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the first @-@ place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place teams . 
 During the regular season , games were played on a Friday night and a <unk> on Saturday ; in each <unk> one of the two games was shortened to seven innings . The exception to this was when Perth played their home games ; they played on a Thursday night instead of a <unk> on Saturday . Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday , Saturday and Sunday .

 The 2010 series allowed each team to make use of a 19 @-@ man active roster . <unk> were made in two cases that allowed teams ' active <unk> to expand to 21 players , both times for the same reason . Two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather . Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season ; make @-@ up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams , and this resulted in two four @-@ game series . In both cases , the teams had a 19 @-@ man roster for the make @-@ up game , and an expanded 21 @-@ man roster for the originally scheduled series .

 The 2010 <unk> Shield was contested between five teams from around Australia . In previous years , many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues . This season each team held their home games at only one venue . There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season : the New South Wales <unk> ' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval , whereas all of their other home games were held at <unk> Baseball Stadium . 
 As a result of poor attendance at <unk> Baseball Park , game one of the fifth @-@ round series between New South Wales and the Victoria <unk> was moved to La <unk> University , Melbourne . Although the <unk> games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved game had an attendance of 2 @,@ 200 . Though no further regular season games were moved , the finals series hosted by the <unk> was held at La <unk> University as well . 
 The venues are as follows :

 The Queensland <unk> were the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals , after being swept four games to nil by the Victoria <unk> in round 8 . The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals , despite finishing the round in second position . It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided : the <unk> clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat , which combined with the New South Wales <unk> sweep of the <unk> eliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the <unk> .

 The 2010 <unk> Shield made use of the same finals structure as had been used in the 2009 season . The top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular @-@ season games qualified . The second- and third @-@ place teams faced in each other in a best @-@ of @-@ three series hosted by the second @-@ place team . The winner of that series then faced the first @-@ place team for a best @-@ of @-@ three series . South Australia hosted the New South Wales <unk> at Norwood Oval , Adelaide , while the Victoria <unk> hosted the championship series at La <unk> University , Melbourne . In the finals , the home team and away team alternated during each of the series . As a result , South Australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against New South Wales , as was Victoria in the championship series . 
 After defeating the <unk> two games to one in the semi @-@ final series , South Australia progressed to the championship series against the <unk> . There they were defeated two games to nil .

 <unk> is the thirteenth Spanish @-@ language studio album by <unk> singer @-@ songwriter Ricardo <unk> , released on 23 September 2011 . Recorded in the United States and Mexico , it was produced by <unk> with Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Puerto <unk> singer @-@ songwriter Tommy Torres . The album — the first independent release by <unk> after he was signed by Sony Music in 1993 and Warner Music in 2008 — was issued by his own label , <unk> . 
 <unk> and written in a year , the record marks <unk> and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For <unk> , <unk> returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for <unk> <unk> ( 2010 ) . While producing the latter , he had used fewer instruments to <unk> his sound , having introduced what had been called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " in his music . <unk> has been compared to his earlier recordings , <unk> ( 1994 ) and Animal <unk> ( 1993 ) . 
 <unk> became <unk> 's fourth number @-@ one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums where it debuted for the week ending 22 October 2011 . For thirteen non @-@ consecutive weeks it topped the Latin Pop Albums chart , and reached number one on the Mexican Albums Chart . It is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the Billboard 200 ( reaching number sixty @-@ five ) , and his fourth album to chart in Spain ( peaking at number sixty @-@ eight ) . Within one week after its release <unk> was certified gold in Chile , the United States and Mexico and certified platinum in Venezuela and Argentina . 
 Five singles have been released from the album . The lead single , " El Amor " , became a commercial success in several Latin American countries and was number one on the Billboard Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts . It was followed by " <unk> Tú " ( featuring <unk> <unk> ) , which reached number one on the Latin Pop Songs , number two on the Latin Songs charts and topped several other national charts . " Mi <unk> Se Me <unk> <unk> <unk> " was released in May 2012 ; " Te <unk> " in July 2012 , and " Si Tu No <unk> " in November 2012 . To promote <unk> , <unk> embarked on his <unk> World Tour .

 In 2010 , <unk> wanted to change his musical style ; after experimenting with using as few instruments as possible , he obtained a sound similar to an a <unk> performance ( <unk> his sound ) and introduced what he called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " to his music . This was heard on his twelfth studio album , <unk> <unk> . <unk> produced the album with Dan Warner , who has worked with <unk> , <unk> Dion and Christina Aguilera . When promoting the album <unk> said , " [ songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we <unk> them with arrangements looking to <unk> their qualities and we end up hiding them " . <unk> <unk> became the first album since <unk> which <unk> recorded without Torres . 
 Weeks before the release of <unk> , <unk> issued a letter raising the issue of his past relationships with recording companies . He revealed the circumstances of his first contract : " a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they did not sign me in , they won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] " . <unk> further explained that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " from his most successful albums . <unk> is <unk> 's first independent release through his own label : <unk> , a company he created to <unk> his career . The company is presided by <unk> and several friends ( including photographer @-@ director Ricardo Calderón , Universal Music <unk> executive <unk> <unk> and BMG 's Miriam <unk> ) , and is based in Miami and Mexico City . <unk> commented that his independence represented compromise more than freedom , stating that " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to <unk> , in the best way possible , such independence " . Billboard notes that , although other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels , <unk> is the most important Latin pop artist to do so . Although the album is marketed within the new label , distribution was handled by Warner Music .

 <unk> marked <unk> 's fourth collaboration with Torres . The latter was a composer and producer , also receiving background @-@ vocal credit . The musicians first worked together in 2005 , when <unk> released his tenth studio album ( <unk> ) . He stated that he first " tested " Torres by sending him the " <unk> and <unk> tracks " on the album : " <unk> A <unk> Solo " and " <unk> " . Torres then " went all out on the first demo , hiring a full band that included a string orchestra " . In <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 2007 ) , Torres produced the singles " <unk> " and " <unk> " and provided background vocals on the remastered versions of <unk> 's past hits . In <unk> <unk> ( 2008 ) , Torres produced several tracks ; one was the lead single " <unk> <unk> " , considered <unk> 's " biggest hit in years " by Jason <unk> of Allmusic . 
 The album was composed over a one @-@ year period . Most of its production was handled by three producers familiar with <unk> 's work : Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Dan <unk> . Tommy Torres also produced three tracks : the lead single " El Amor " , second single " <unk> Tú " and " Hay <unk> " . Victor <unk> produced two songs , ( " <unk> " and the piano version of " Mi <unk> Se Me <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) and Julio <unk> aided in the production of " <unk> " . <unk> wrote all the songs except " El Amor " ( which was co @-@ written with Torres ) . The album was recorded and produced in several cities in the United States and Mexico . <unk> was mixed at the Blue <unk> in Nashville , Tennessee , and mastered by Tom Coyne and <unk> Merrill at Sterling Sound in New York City . With Torres ' return to producing <unk> regained the classic , trademark sound which Torres helped develop since 2005 .

 <unk> opens with " Lo Que <unk> <unk> <unk> Mal " , a Latin pop song and the only track composed by Dan Warner instead of <unk> ( who wrote the lyrics ) . " El Amor " was motivated by <unk> 's desire to examine " those big , dark events within love that nobody talks about " ; he continued , " [ the ] dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value . " <unk> added , " So many good things <unk> love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones " . In a February 2012 interview , <unk> stated that " El Amor " was the " most <unk> " song he had released to date , explaining that their choice of the song was a " contradiction " because it was not " the song which could better represent the entire album " . He described it as " very strong " and " a bit dark " . The single marked <unk> 's return to his signature , mainstream sound after the Cuban music influenced <unk> <unk> 's lead single " <unk> " , a mixture of salsa and merengue which failed to make an impact in the United States . 
 The album includes " <unk> Tú " , a duet with <unk> singer <unk> <unk> . Its instrumentation consists of piano , violin , guitars , drums and other percussion . Although <unk> stated that he " had the possibilities to record this song with very well known people " he expressed his happiness with <unk> , revealing that " the possibilities of doing it with her , for me , are a celebration " . He described <unk> as " incredibly talented " , a " <unk> " and a " fantastic human being " . <unk> named " <unk> Tú " as one of the most important songs on the album . " Mi <unk> Se Me <unk> <unk> <unk> " took two years to complete and <unk> dedicated it to his mother , <unk> <unk> . He stated that he wrote it " as a gift for my mom on Mother 's Day " and that he thought " the idea of including it on the album was very good " . As with his single " Señora De Las <unk> <unk> " ( on 1994 's <unk> ) , at first he never thought to include the song on an album . " <unk> " evokes " the image of some friends " <unk> had at college ; he asserted that he " appears constantly there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradiction of all those things we fought in those moments . It 's the history of a student leader that becomes a president " . <unk> dedicated the album to his father , who died in 2011 .

 = 2003 Pacific typhoon season = 
 
 The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average <unk> period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became <unk> . Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific . 
 The season ran year @-@ round , with the first storm , <unk> , developing west of the Marshall Islands on January 15 . In April , Typhoon <unk> became one of the longest @-@ lasting Pacific <unk> in history and attained <unk> records for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon Imbudo in July caused several deaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoon <unk> became one of the costliest <unk> in recorded history after striking South Korea ; <unk> was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) . In late November , Typhoon <unk> devastated areas of Yap State in the <unk> States of <unk> . The season closed with the <unk> of a tropical depression east of the Philippines on December 27 . 
 The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the " W " <unk> added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .

 On March 5 , 2003 , <unk> from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk ( <unk> ) <unk> issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year average of 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their <unk> , with their April and August <unk> being the most accurate . 
 Similarly , <unk> working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 <unk> . As with the <unk> , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @-@ Southern <unk> . The City University of Hong Kong revised their <unk> on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in their <unk> for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specialized <unk> for the South China Sea were substantially off . 
 During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official Regional <unk> Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued <unk> and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issued <unk> based on a <unk> tropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific <unk> . 
 
 = = Season summary = = 
 
 Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . <unk> divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @-@ year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and <unk> was 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA . 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm <unk> on January 15 . After its <unk> five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon <unk> in mid @-@ April ; <unk> was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon <unk> , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the <unk> Islands and the Korean Peninsula . 
 Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development of <unk> Imbudo and <unk> , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ <unk> million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which also struck southeastern China . Typhoon <unk> earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths . 
 <unk> was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , <unk> . However , <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 4 @.@ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , <unk> and <unk> , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was <unk> average , with two <unk> developing . The second typhoon , <unk> , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 1 @.@ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .

 In storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1 @-@ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @-@ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone .

 On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into <unk> near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system <unk> in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained <unk> as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression . 
 Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again <unk> in strength , resulting in a brief <unk> by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its <unk> as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name <unk> . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that <unk> peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . <unk> by the same nearby subtropical ridge , <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center <unk> from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of <unk> .

 <unk> developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed from any <unk> . Shortly after development , <unk> quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . <unk> slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 . <unk> continued and late on April 15 , <unk> reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 46 inHg ) . Following peak intensity , <unk> would begin to track northwest and <unk> in strength , <unk> an additional two times in intensity . On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track <unk> for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , <unk> would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on <unk> . Following landfall , <unk> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 25 , which persisted until crossing the International Dateline towards the end of April 2003 . 
 Shortly after developing , <unk> caused two fatalities in <unk> in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam . Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other <unk> measures in the Philippines after <unk> indicated the potential for strong winds and rain . However , ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with <unk> remained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however , <unk> would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan . Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in the <unk> Islands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 million ) in agricultural damage on <unk> Island . One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . In <unk> , heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> Prefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall , <unk> resulted in three fatalities .

 <unk> on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low @-@ pressure area southwest of <unk> . Within highly <unk> conditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly <unk> . However , a <unk> trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ <unk> . Following the system 's naming , Chan @-@ <unk> temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . <unk> intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @-@ <unk> reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . 
 Following peak intensity , Chan @-@ <unk> began to intake dry air beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued to <unk> as the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east of <unk> , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , Chan @-@ <unk> had lost much of its convection due to wind shear . Early on May 27 , Chan @-@ <unk> had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . These extratropical remnants dissipated south of the <unk> Islands the following day . Early in the typhoon 's existence , Chan @-@ <unk> posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . However , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently <unk> <unk> volcano towards the island , prompting <unk> measures in Guam . <unk> were reported on the island , forcing the cancellation of several flights . As a tropical storm , Chan @-@ <unk> caused some damage to homes and crops on <unk> , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 @,@ <unk> ton fishing vessel , the <unk> <unk> , sank during the storm . The ship was valued at $ 16 million .

 Tropical Storm <unk> developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off as <unk> executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and <unk> before reforming in the Philippine Sea . Afterwards <unk> began <unk> and reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 94 inHg ) . Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of <unk> on June 4 . 
 The erratic and slow movement of <unk> off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons in the archipelago . Precipitation peaked at <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 5 in ) near <unk> . Rising <unk> resulted in the temporary <unk> of government offices and numerous mudslides . In addition , strong winds caused widespread power outages . Overall damage from <unk> in the Philippines amounted to <unk> 192 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 65 million ) . The floods also displaced 8 @,@ 367 people in 1 @,@ <unk> families and destroyed 178 homes . <unk> and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan , particularly in southwestern regions . Rainfall there peaked at <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 62 in ) . Flood damage was worst in <unk> and <unk> Prefectures , where several buildings were destroyed by <unk> . Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides . Overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 28 @.@ 2 million in damage , much of which occurred in Japan , though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines .

 In late May , an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following day , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection . <unk> moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm 's early stages . These conditions <unk> as the depression tracked northeast , and at 0000 UTC on June 1 , the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> . Throughout the course of the day , <unk> continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . 
 However , upon moving through the <unk> Channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting in its <unk> to tropical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 . <unk> continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from <unk> , damage remained minimal ; however , as <unk> passed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking at 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) in <unk> , Okinawa .

 A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of <unk> on June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of <unk> . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name " <unk> " . <unk> moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well @-@ defined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> at around <unk> UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the <unk> Islands . The extratropical remnants of <unk> continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 . 
 While offshore the Philippines , <unk> dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused <unk> 131 million ( PHP , $ 2 @.@ 46 million USD ) in damage and 12 deaths . On the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) .

 On July 15 , the JMA estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> about <unk> km ( 415 mi ) east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @-@ northwest for much of its duration . With warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when PAGASA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon <unk> . Around that time , Imbudo was rapidly intensifying , developing a well @-@ defined eye . At 1200 UTC on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the same time , the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . At 0300 UTC on July 22 , Imbudo struck northern Luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the JTWC . It weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified in the South China Sea , striking southern China near Yangjiang , Guangdong on July 24 . Imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 . 
 In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14 @,@ 000 people . Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoon <unk> five years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days . Damage was heaviest in the Cagayan Valley , where over 80 @,@ 000 people were displaced by the storm . In Isabela , high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . Throughout the Philippines , Imbudo damaged or destroyed 62 @,@ 314 houses , causing <unk> billion ( 2003 PHP , $ 86 million 2003 USD ) in damage . There were 64 deaths in the country .

 <unk> originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as <unk> made landfall on <unk> on July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of <unk> prior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused <unk> to dissipate over Laos on July 23 . 
 Shortly after development , <unk> tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In <unk> , <unk> caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in ) at a station on <unk> Mountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated <unk> ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed . Widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly in Vietnam 's northern provinces .

 <unk> spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2 . <unk> reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) . This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system ; this was followed by <unk> making landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3 . Subsequently , the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near <unk> , China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland , and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall . 
 In Taiwan , where <unk> first made landfall , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding . Commercial flights , schools , and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm . Precipitation there peaked at 653 mm ( 25 @.@ 71 in ) over a period of nearly two days in <unk> County . <unk> damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at over <unk> $ 70 million ( US $ 2 million ) . In China , record rainfall was reported . The worst impacted city was <unk> , where losses due to <unk> reached <unk> ¥ 240 million ( US $ 29 million ) and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due to <unk> drought conditions , 703 cloud <unk> operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area . Overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and three deaths .

 A tropical depression developed on August 2 southeast of Guam , and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 3 and a typhoon a day later . <unk> formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August 7 . The typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast . <unk> made landfall on the Japanese island of <unk> on August 8 , and later moved across portions of <unk> and <unk> . After weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later . 
 While passing northeast of the Philippines , the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago . The eye crossed over Okinawa , where <unk> left 166 @,@ 800 people without power and caused 10 injuries . Near where <unk> first struck Japan , <unk> reported a peak wind gust of 166 km / h ( 103 mph ) , at the time the third strongest on record there .

 <unk> originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough east of <unk> State on August 13 . Despite rather favorable conditions , the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18 . However , these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later . <unk> was rather rapid upon the storm 's <unk> – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later . Shortly after , <unk> made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm , though it was able to <unk> over warm waters . Once again at typhoon intensity , <unk> <unk> <unk> before moving over the <unk> Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near <unk> <unk> , Vietnam on August 25 . Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as <unk> moved across northern Vietnam , where the storm met its demise the following day . 
 <unk> first struck the Philippines , resulting in heavy rainfall and <unk> approximately 1 @,@ 000 families . The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person . <unk> 's effects were much more severe in China . In Hong Kong , eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon 's outer rainbands .

 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression <unk> near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of <unk> , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed <unk> as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China . 
 Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) in <unk> , Zhejiang , which were largely beneficial in <unk> drought conditions , while winds gusted to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) .

 On August 27 , a tropical depression developed about 520 km ( 325 mi ) northwest of Guam , which initially drifted to the southwest before turning to the northwest . On August 29 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> , and that day PAGASA began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm <unk> . The storm quickly intensified into a typhoon , after developing an eye in the center . On September 1 , the JMA estimated <unk> attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . While near peak intensity , the center of <unk> passed about 45 km ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on September 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , making it the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . <unk> rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guangxi . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall , killing one person . While in the vicinity , <unk> produced gusts of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on <unk> , a Japanese <unk> of Okinawa .

 Typhoon <unk> formed on September 4 from the monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean . It slowly intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward , and <unk> became a typhoon on September 8 . That day , it quickly intensified due to favorable conditions , developing a well @-@ defined eye and reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . While near peak intensity , <unk> was <unk> and began turning to the north @-@ northeast . The eyewall soon after passed over the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> on September 10 , producing the fourth lowest pressure on record in Japan after a pressure of <unk> mbar ( 26 @.@ 9 inHg ) was recorded . With warm waters , <unk> was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of <unk> , South Korea on September 12 . On <unk> Island , <unk> produced a peak wind gust of 216 km / h ( 134 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , both setting records for the country , and making it the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since record @-@ keeping began in the country in 1904 . The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day , although the remnants persisted for several more days , bringing strong winds to northern Japan .

 In the middle of September , the monsoon trough spawned a rapidly organizing disturbance east @-@ northeast of Luzon , with weak wind shear and favorable conditions . On September 16 , the JMA classified it as a tropical depression , and the JTWC initiated advisories the next day . The system moved to the northwest due to the subtropical ridge to the northeast and later to the north . On September 18 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> @-@ <unk> , the same day that PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm <unk> .

The remnants of <unk> @-@ <unk> continued to the northeast , exited the basin on September 24 , and eventually struck southern Alaska on September 25 . 
 Wind gusts in Okinawa reached 115 km / h ( 72 mph ) , while on the volcanic island of <unk> @-@ <unk> , gusts reached <unk> km / h ( 133 mph ) . On the Japanese mainland , winds gusted to 126 km / h ( 78 mph ) at <unk> , <unk> . <unk> @-@ <unk> dropped heavy rainfall while near Japan , peaking at 316 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) on <unk> @-@ <unk> . In Okinawa , <unk> @-@ <unk> flooded a boat , forcing its occupants to be rescued by the Coast Guard . Also on the island , heavy rainfall caused landslides and flooded houses .

 Towards the end of September , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance east @-@ northeast of Yap , which became a tropical depression on September 24 . There were initially several <unk> , with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 27 , although the JMA did not follow suit until the following day while near <unk> @-@ <unk> . Also that day , <unk> passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . The convection diminished near the center , causing <unk> to become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through the <unk> Islands , eventually passing south of mainland Alaska on October 7 . 
 On <unk> @-@ <unk> , Typhoon <unk> produced sustained winds of 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which was the third strongest on record for the station . Rainfall there reached 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) . Wind gusts on Iwo Jima peaked at 109 km / h ( 68 mph ) .

 In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Luzon and Guam , developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoon <unk> to the east . For several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> , and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow , <unk> quickly intensified into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . On October 26 , <unk> became extratropical to the east of Japan and dissipated the next day . The passage of the typhoon caused surface <unk> a concentration in the ocean to increase 30 @-@ fold .

 The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoon <unk> also produced an area of convection to the north @-@ northeast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> on October 21 . After an eye began to form , <unk> was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough caused <unk> to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N. Subsequently , <unk> rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast , beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward . 
 Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and <unk> deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @-@ upgraded <unk> to typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , <unk> re @-@ intensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to JMA , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , and <unk> became extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California .

 Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest of <unk> and quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving west @-@ northwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Early on November 1 , <unk> made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of <unk> . The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 , <unk> turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after <unk> offshore eastern Taiwan , <unk> continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> dropped about 150 mm ( 6 in ) of rainfall , which flooded the Cagayan River and killed four people . In Taiwan , rainfall reached <unk> mm ( 21 @.@ 8 in ) in <unk> County . On the Japanese island of <unk> , rainfall totaled 197 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 in ) , which broke the <unk> and daily record for the station in November .

 A tropical depression developed near Yap on November 11 . The system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the Philippines . An anticyclone <unk> allowed for strengthening , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> on November 12 . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm <unk> . At around 1600 UTC on November 13 , <unk> made landfall on northern <unk> Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea weakened but quickly re @-@ intensified while continuing to the west @-@ northwest . The JTWC estimated peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) on November 16 , and later that day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On November 18 , <unk> passed near southwestern <unk> and weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . By the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over <unk> , China . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . The storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions . According to the PAGASA in its post @-@ storm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm . On <unk> , the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage , <unk> 64 @,@ 000 ha ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) of fields and killing 400 head of livestock . With about 800 homes destroyed , damage on <unk> amounted to $ 197 million ( 2003 USD ) . Effects were minor in mainland China .

 Typhoon <unk> formed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or west @-@ southwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . <unk> later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and after <unk> to the northeast , <unk> became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 . 
 Typhoon <unk> first affected <unk> with gusty winds , and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes in <unk> State . There , high waves flooded roads and homes , while high winds damaged crops . Damage was heaviest in Yap State , mostly in the small <unk> <unk> and <unk> Island . On both islands , the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops . Rainfall reached 263 mm ( 10 @.@ 35 in ) on <unk> , and gusts reached 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) . Throughout the <unk> , damage totaled about $ 1 @.@ 7 million , although there were no deaths . The damage prompted the <unk> government to declare two states as disaster areas , as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government . While <unk> was becoming extratropical , it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13 years . The storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight <unk> .

 An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of <unk> , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> , and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories . 
 On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> on July 30 off the east coast of <unk> . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about <unk> million ( PHP , $ 145 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it <unk> . There were several <unk> in the region , with Tropical Storm <unk> to the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classified <unk> as a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 in ) in <unk> , <unk> . 
 On September 5 , former Hurricane <unk> crossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression <unk> on September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 In October , the JTWC classified Tropical Depression <unk> early in the month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward before <unk> to the northwest . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored Tropical Depression <unk> , which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection . Described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front . The depression moved through <unk> and <unk> before dissipating on October 13 . The depression dropped 285 mm ( 11 @.@ 2 in ) of rainfall in <unk> , while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h ( 135 mph ) through a storm @-@ produced <unk> . The winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9 @,@ 000 homes without power . The depression also killed two people due to <unk> . On October 16 , the JMA briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of the <unk> Islands . On October 22 , a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea , classified by PAGASA as <unk> . The system moved eastward and crossed <unk> before dissipating on October 24 . In the Philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . Also in October , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the Gulf of Thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the Indian Ocean , dropping heavy rainfall in Thailand . 
 In mid @-@ November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm <unk> . The system made landfall in northeastern <unk> and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .

 An <unk> is an organic molecule that features a three @-@ membered <unk> containing oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon . In their largest application , <unk> are <unk> in the industrial production of <unk> . <unk> derivatives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of <unk> , including alpha <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , and other <unk> transfer reactions . <unk> also serve as precursors to <unk> and participate in [ 3 + 2 ] <unk> with various <unk> to form substituted five @-@ membered <unk> . <unk> <unk> derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to <unk> <unk> as well as other substrates . Some <unk> also have the property of a high barrier to <unk> of the nitrogen , allowing for the possibility of <unk> at the nitrogen center . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 <unk> derivatives were first reported in the mid @-@ 1950s by <unk> and subsequently by <unk> and Horner and <unk> . Whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as <unk> due to their high <unk> , <unk> allow for <unk> transfer of both <unk> . This unusual reactivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak N @-@ O bond . <unk> tend to attack at the <unk> nitrogen when the nitrogen <unk> is small ( R1 = H ) , and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen <unk> has greater <unk> bulk . The unusual electronics of the <unk> system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including , but not limited to : α @-@ <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , selective oxidation of sulfides and <unk> , <unk> of N @-@ <unk> and N @-@ <unk> . 
 The <unk> process for the industrial production of <unk> through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen <unk> in the presence of <unk> was developed in the early 1970s . 
 <unk> <unk> proved useful in the syntheses of complex natural product , such as <unk> which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent . Both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ <unk> with <unk> .

 = = = N @-@ H , N @-@ <unk> , N @-@ <unk> = = = 
 
 The two main approaches to synthesis of N @-@ H , N @-@ <unk> , and N @-@ <unk> are oxidation of <unk> with <unk> ( A ) and <unk> of <unk> ( B ) . 
 Additionally , oxidation of <unk> <unk> and oxidation of <unk> with <unk> <unk> may yield <unk> <unk> . Some <unk> have the unique property of <unk> stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an <unk> barrier of 24 to 31 <unk> / <unk> . <unk> <unk> where <unk> is entirely due to <unk> stable nitrogen are reported . 
 
 = = = N @-@ <unk> = = = 
 
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s Franklin A. Davis synthesized the first N @-@ <unk> , which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents , and are the most predominantly used class of <unk> today . While originally synthesized with <unk> and the phase transfer catalyst <unk> chloride , an improved synthesis using <unk> as the <unk> is now most prevalent . 
 Many N @-@ <unk> are used today , each with slightly different properties and reactivity . These reagents are summarized in the table below . 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 With highly electron withdrawing <unk> <unk> , <unk> exhibit reactivity more similar to that of <unk> than typical <unk> . Notably , <unk> <unk> certain C @-@ H bonds with high selectivity . <unk> <unk> may be synthesized by <unk> a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and a metal fluoride to act as an HF <unk> .

 <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> process for the production of <unk> . Many millions of kilograms of <unk> are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is <unk> in the presence of methyl <unk> <unk> to give the <unk> : 
 Me ( <unk> ) C = O + <unk> + <unk> → Me ( <unk> ) <unk> + H2O 
 In subsequent steps the <unk> is converted to the <unk> , which is the immediate en route to <unk> : 
 Me ( <unk> ) <unk> + <unk> → Me ( <unk> ) C = <unk> + H2O

 α @-@ <unk> , or <unk> , are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural <unk> α @-@ <unk> have been synthesized in many ways , including reduction of α @-@ <unk> , substitution of a <unk> for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> ) - ( <unk> <unk> ) ( <unk> ) and N @-@ <unk> are the most common <unk> sources of oxygen implemented in this process . One advantage of using N @-@ <unk> is that higher <unk> induction is almost invariably observed relative to <unk> and other <unk> . High yield ( 77 @-@ 91 % ) and <unk> ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are reported for α @-@ <unk> with the Evans ' <unk> auxiliary with N @-@ <unk> as the <unk> . <unk> induction has been demonstrated with many other <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , including <unk> and <unk> . 
 Extensive work has been reported on asymmetric <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that <unk> this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the <unk> bulk of R1 determines the face of approach . 
 The selectivity of some <unk> may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal <unk> is stabilized by <unk> from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton . 
 α @-@ <unk> with <unk> has been widely implemented in total synthesis . It is a key step in both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis . Additionally , <unk> implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( <unk> 1 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> [ 5 @.@ 5 ] <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> ) System of <unk> acid .

 <unk> of <unk> is a common reaction because epoxides can be <unk> in a number of useful ways . <unk> , laboratory <unk> is carried out with <unk> or other <unk> . <unk> have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides . ( − ) <unk> was synthesized via <unk> <unk> as a late stage transformation as seen below . 
 Another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric <unk> . A number of asymmetric <unk> exist : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> @-@ Colonna <unk> . These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity . The <unk> <unk> is specific to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> requires <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> requires α @-@ β <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> act <unk> on many <unk> <unk> . It has even possible to effect <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> unit . Further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of <unk> excess become practical for large scale synthesis . <unk> et al. have investigated asymmetric <unk> with a <unk> <unk> salt using <unk> as the stoichiometric <unk> seen below .

 <unk> <unk> are known to <unk> <unk> <unk> with remarkable <unk> , and <unk> . This is a highly <unk> transformation , and similar reactivity and <unk> is seldom rivaled , especially considering the <unk> nature of the <unk> . <unk> <unk> show high selectivity toward tertiary <unk> . <unk> of primary <unk> and <unk> of a compound with two <unk> sites have never been observed . <unk> of <unk> is very high , often 95 - 98 % . ( <unk> of <unk> may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt ) .

 <unk> of <unk> with N @-@ <unk> <unk> is quite versatile in the breadth of possible <unk> and corresponding products . <unk> may be derived from the <unk> of secondary or tertiary <unk> , <unk> and <unk> may be formed from their corresponding <unk> and <unk> , <unk> may be formed from <unk> and α @-@ <unk> may be formed by attack of corresponding <unk> .

 The transfer of <unk> <unk> is more difficult than that of <unk> <unk> , although , unlike amine transfer by <unk> , there are no alternative methods that directly transfer <unk> <unk> . <unk> transfer has primarily been performed using <unk> and <unk> as <unk> . Very few transfers of <unk> <unk> to carbon <unk> have been successfully performed , although some do exist in the literature .

 <unk> have been found to undergo <unk> reactions via a radical mechanism when <unk> with <unk> light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as <unk> <unk> <unk> undergo ring expansions to the corresponding <unk> . <unk> , the migrating <unk> is determined by a <unk> effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product . In light of this effect , it is possible to take advantage of the <unk> nitrogen due to high <unk> barrier to direct the <unk> . This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed <unk> in the <unk> below . In the <unk> on the left the <unk> unfavorable product is observed exclusively , while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored . 
 <unk> takes advantage of this <unk> as the key step in his synthesis of ( + ) <unk> , a natural medicine classified by the <unk> as possibly effective in the treatment of <unk> <unk> and the sexual problems caused by selective <unk> <unk> inhibitors . 
 It is also notable that <unk> will <unk> <unk> to <unk> . <unk> @-@ trans selectivity of the resulting <unk> is poor , however , yields are good to excellent . It is thought that some <unk> <unk> over time through a <unk> intermediate .

 The Battle of <unk> ( also known as the Battle of <unk> , Battle of <unk> and Battle of <unk> ; German : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , on 11 November 1805 was an engagement in the Napoleonic Wars during the War of the Third Coalition . <unk> ( modern <unk> ) is located in the <unk> Valley , on the River <unk> , 73 kilometers ( 45 mi ) upstream from Vienna , Austria . The river makes a crescent @-@ shaped curve between <unk> and nearby <unk> an der <unk> and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains . 
 At <unk> a combined force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by <unk> <unk> <unk> . The French division was part of the newly created VIII Corps , the so @-@ called Corps <unk> , under command of <unk> <unk> . In pursuing the Austrian retreat from <unk> , <unk> had over @-@ extended his three divisions along the north bank of the <unk> . Mikhail <unk> <unk> , commander of the Coalition force , <unk> <unk> to send <unk> 's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns . They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division , under command of Pierre <unk> de l <unk> . The battle extended well into the night . Both sides claimed victory . The French lost more than a third of their participants , and <unk> 's division experienced over 40 percent losses . The Austrians and Russians also had heavy <unk> to 16 <unk> perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von <unk> , one of Austria 's most capable chiefs of staff . 
 The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo @-@ Austrian defeat at the Battle of <unk> . After <unk> Austria withdrew from the war . The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 In a series of conflicts from 1803 @-@ 15 known as the Napoleonic Wars , various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution ( 1789 ) , these further revolutionized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented <unk> , mainly due to mass conscription . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose quickly as the Grande <unk> conquered most of Europe , and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon 's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 , known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars .

 From 1803 @-@ 06 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states ( see table at right ) . Although several naval battles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , predominantly in two major land operations in the <unk> valley : the Ulm campaign in the upper <unk> and the Vienna campaign , in the middle <unk> valley . 
 Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria 's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805 . After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , <unk> <unk> emperor 's <unk> advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 – 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack , Lieutenant Field Marshal and <unk> @-@ General of the Army , implemented his own restructuring . Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach . <unk> in the field , Mack 's plan also undermined the overall command and <unk> structure . Regardless , Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military 's readiness . Furthermore , after <unk> Napoleon 's maneuvers in <unk> , Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French <unk> . His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor , Francis II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Responding to the report and rampant anti @-@ French fever in Vienna , Francis dismissed Charles from his post as <unk> and appointed his <unk> brother @-@ in @-@ law , <unk> Ferdinand , as commander . 
 The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles , having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , day @-@ to @-@ day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equally ill @-@ suited for such an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campaign , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of <unk> , an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army .

 The campaign in the upper <unk> valley began in October , with several clashes in <unk> . Near the Bavarian town of <unk> , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) northwest of <unk> , on 8 October the 1st Regiment of <unk> , part of <unk> 's Reserve Cavalry Corps , and grenadiers of <unk> ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size . The Austrians were <unk> in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4 @,@ 000 <unk> and 8 @,@ 000 grenadiers . Nearly 3 @,@ 000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded . A day later , at another small town , <unk> south of the <unk> <unk> French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the <unk> and , <unk> , chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm . 
 The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At <unk> , Johann von <unk> arranged his 25 @,@ 000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierre <unk> de l <unk> attacked <unk> 's force with fewer than 8 @,@ 000 men . The French lost 1 @,@ 500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th <unk> , <unk> 's force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . 
 <unk> 's victory was a singular success . On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north : one under Johann <unk> <unk> headed toward <unk> to secure the bridge there , and the other under Franz von <unk> went north with most of the heavy artillery . <unk> the opportunity , Marshal Michel <unk> <unk> the rest of his VI Corps forward to re @-@ establish contact with <unk> , who was still north of the <unk> . In a two @-@ <unk> attack <unk> sent one division to the south of <unk> on the right bank of the <unk> . This division began the assault at <unk> . At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against <unk> 's position . After clearing Austrian <unk> from a bridge , the French attacked and captured a strategically located <unk> at the top of the hill at bayonet point . The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French , but the Austrian infantry broke and ran . In this engagement alone , the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park , 6 @,@ 000 ( out of 8 @,@ 000 total participants ) dead , wounded or captured and four colors . <unk> 's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the <unk> . 
 Napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian <unk> command structure and poor supply apparatus . Mack completely <unk> the French <unk> and scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80 @,@ 000 men . At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his <unk> army of 20 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 273 cavalry . The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held .

 The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail <unk> also <unk> away from the French , withdrawing to the east . At the <unk> river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von <unk> . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in <unk> . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. <unk> and crossed the <unk> river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the <unk> , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village <unk> , until the late afternoon . 
 
 = = = Battlefield = = = 
 
 To the east of Stein , 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) down an old road , lay <unk> , with its small population of a few hundred , at the confluence of the stream of that name and the <unk> . To the west of Stein the <unk> made a large curve , creating a crescent @-@ shaped floodplain between it and the mountains . At the far western end of the floodplain , where the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge , was <unk> with its castle , known as <unk> <unk> . The castle had served as a prison for Richard I of England in <unk> . In 1645 – 46 , during the Thirty Years War , the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew . It stands at 159 meters ( 522 ft ) , on the highest ridge of a mountain <unk> with <unk> and pinnacles of granite . Because the mountain was sparsely <unk> , it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks . <unk> canyons cut through the mountain , and widen into the plain below . Between <unk> and Stein , on the flood plain , lay the hamlets of <unk> and <unk> . Near the hamlets , the <unk> flood plain was at its <unk> , extending at the most 762 meters ( 2 @,@ 500 ft ) from the base of the <unk> mountain to the bank of the river . 
 The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced <unk> and the wine producers formed St. Paul <unk> ' Guild in <unk> , the oldest such guild in the German @-@ speaking world . <unk> vineyards extended up the sides of the <unk> River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . The <unk> plain supported both <unk> and agriculture . As the terrain became <unk> , the vines grew in terraces built from the dark <unk> , primordial rock . From <unk> to <unk> the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @-@ of @-@ sight between the two towns .

 Napoleon had calculated that <unk> would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande <unk> to create a new VIII Corps . This corps was to secure the north shore of the <unk> , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to Russia . 
 The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of <unk> <unk> , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry ( see Order of Battle below ) . Corps <unk> , as it was known , crossed the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> in early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the <unk> . Operating independently , the <unk> 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks . Gen. <unk> 's division ( about 6 @,@ 000 men ) took the lead ; <unk> was with them . They were followed by Gen. <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) about one day 's march behind . Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) , marching another day behind <unk> , brought up the rear . A flotilla of 50 boats acquired at <unk> provided communications across the <unk> . Before sending <unk> on his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advised <unk> to secure all <unk> of the <unk> between <unk> and Vienna . 
 On 9 November <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) to <unk> by early on the following afternoon . Here it <unk> with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein . In <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position seemed secure , he had ignored Napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left ( north ) flank . 
 This failure was an important factor when <unk> lost his corps ' so @-@ called " eyes " : after he and <unk> had crossed the <unk> , the French <unk> had <unk> to the northwest , leaving only three squadrons of the 4th <unk> available for reconnaissance . These had left the division and were operating independently of <unk> 's command . Consequently , <unk> and <unk> marched <unk> through the narrow canyon west of <unk> , not knowing what lay ahead of them . <unk> had led the Coalition army across the <unk> at <unk> , a short distance past Stein , and destroyed the bridge behind him . His actions deprived the French commanders of a possible route across the <unk> , putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat . In this decision <unk> abandoned Vienna to the French , who were <unk> on the Austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , for the security of uniting with reinforcements from <unk> . <unk> chose a military solution over a political one . 
 Unknown to either <unk> or <unk> , the Coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24 @,@ 000 men ( mostly Russians and a few Austrians ) within a few kilometers of the French position at <unk> . In comparison , <unk> 's division had only 6 @,@ 000 men . The Austro @-@ Russian force was a mixture of infantry , <unk> ( usually deployed as <unk> ) , Russian <unk> and Russian and Austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces . <unk> , who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian <unk> <unk> , had overall command . The Russian cavalry , units of the greatly feared Cossacks , were well @-@ suited for patrolling the river bank ; indeed , on 9 November they had taken 40 French soldiers as prisoners . Furthermore , reinforcements stood in Moravia , less than two weeks ' march away . If the main body of the French army crossed the river , they would require time to prepare . <unk> would have ample warning of any large @-@ scale French movement . 
 After the afternoon 's initial <unk> with the French , <unk> held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at <unk> , at the great <unk> there . He knew several things . First , he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured . He also knew that <unk> had crossed at <unk> and was well ahead of any French reinforcements : <unk> had crossed at <unk> and , by 10 November , stood at <unk> , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and <unk> was another 7 kilometers ( 4 mi ) further behind him . <unk> knew the size of the French <unk> division <unk> its positions , and he knew that most of the <unk> were not covering the French flank but had turned north . He also knew , or had made a good <unk> , about Napoleon 's orders , so he knew what to offer <unk> and <unk> as bait . 
 
 = = = Battle plan = = = 
 
 In addition to the Russian generals , the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von <unk> and Friedrich Karl Wilhelm , <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> , who had retired from the military in 1800 , had been recalled into service after the Ulm <unk> and had come to <unk> highly recommended by the Emperor . He was an experienced <unk> and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he had been <unk> Charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles ' victories . Upon his recall , <unk> was appointed Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Coalition Army . The generals had found among the Austrian force one <unk> Christoph Freiherr von <unk> ( 1753 – 1824 ) , who had knowledge of the local geography . 
 Together , <unk> , <unk> and the other generals , with von <unk> 's advice on the local terrain , <unk> a plan to encircle the French at <unk> . Russian commander Mikhail <unk> <unk> would approach <unk> 's division from the east , supported by <unk> <unk> 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> Gen. <unk> and <unk> , would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at <unk> . 
 
 = = Battle = = 
 
 On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under <unk> 's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving at <unk> by noon ; two more columns , under <unk> and <unk> , moved in wider <unk> , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a <unk> ; <unk> , they would have no option but to <unk> die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , under <unk> and <unk> , would arrive in early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to <unk> , they would not escape the <unk> @-@ like grip of the Coalition army . 
 <unk> accepted the bait of a <unk> Russian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he and <unk> departed from <unk> to seize Stein and <unk> , <unk> the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of <unk> 's troops attacked the French forward positions . <unk> this force was the <unk> Russian rear guard , <unk> ordered Gen. <unk> to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though the villages of <unk> , <unk> and the farm at <unk> . Instead of withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column . 
 Initially <unk> made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army . Realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring rapidly , <unk> sent orders to <unk> 's division to <unk> forward . By mid @-@ morning the French momentum had stalled ; <unk> committed most of his remaining forces to driving <unk> back , leaving a single <unk> 300 <unk> cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4 @,@ 500 French opposed 2 @,@ 600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river . <unk> had no option , for neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen . 
 At this stage of the battle fighting paused . <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's arrival while <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's and <unk> 's . <unk> 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . <unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of <unk> . Caught between two strong forces , <unk> attempted to push his way back through <unk> , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . <unk> through the narrow <unk> canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , <unk> and his division were trapped when more of <unk> 's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow <unk> hampered the Russians ; <unk> 's men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite <unk> 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours , <unk> and <unk> pushed the Russians back up the narrow <unk> in the hillside . At this point , <unk> 's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by <unk> 's column , in the middle by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk> . 
 Earlier in the morning <unk> had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from <unk> , according to instructions . Even before the arrival of <unk> 's <unk> , he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column ( <unk> 's ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to <unk> . Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , <unk> <unk> his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from <unk> 's <unk> force to face these new <unk> . Although superior in numbers , <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was <unk> 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of <unk> 's column , which had <unk> its way through the mountains in the west . 
 <unk> arrived at dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; in mid @-@ November night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper <unk> <unk> . Despite the darkness , <unk> descended out of the <unk> and deployed his troops to <unk> <unk> 's flank . As his Russians entered the <unk> , they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional force , the French were overwhelmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from <unk> in the dark . Under the cover of darkness , <unk> used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . The French and Russians continued to <unk> <unk> into the night as <unk> encountered one another in the dark . <unk> of <unk> 's force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the <unk> , while they maintained possession of only <unk> and <unk> on the north bank . 
 
 = = = Losses = = = 
 
 The losses were <unk> : <unk> lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds . Aside from losing five guns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured , bringing the loss of <unk> closer to 60 percent ; furthermore , he lost the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment ( France ) and the eagle and <unk> of the 4th <unk> . The Russians lost around 4 @,@ 000 , about 16 percent of their force , and two regimental colors . The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshal <unk> was killed as the battle concluded , probably by Russian <unk> in the confused melee . The vineyards and the villages of <unk> and <unk> were destroyed , as was most of <unk> and Stein . <unk> was heavily damaged ; the French plundered the town at least twice , and " <unk> handled " its inhabitants . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 Both sides claimed victory . Although losses were fairly equal in terms of <unk> wounded or dead on each <unk> Coalition forces went into battle with 24 @,@ 000 men while the French started with <unk> 's division of about 6 @,@ 000 , which grew close to 8 @,@ 000 when <unk> 's men joined the fighting in the afternoon . Regardless , <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division . <unk> for both sides , the fighting was hard . The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways , and <unk> " like chandeliers " hung from the trees . 
 For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> , awaiting reinforcements from <unk> ; the bridges between <unk> and Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had retreated from the field with a badly <unk> division and <unk> had secured the right flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the Military Order of Maria <unk> . 
 For the French , the survival of the Corps <unk> seemed nothing short of a miracle . The remainder of <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually <unk> in Vienna , which the French acquired by deception later in the month . More importantly for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions . Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft . They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at <unk> , <unk> their boats . <unk> into the icy river , most had drowned . Despite this initial panic , <unk> 's column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands . <unk> had demonstrated his tactical <unk> : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French division . In terms of French staffing , <unk> 's failure to guard his flank , especially in the face of Napoleon 's direct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his commander . However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the flamboyant <unk> did more to annoy Napoleon than <unk> had . In assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on <unk> and <unk> : " Napoleon , aware of <unk> 's danger and his own <unk> for it , vented his frustration on <unk> , whom he unjustly accused of abandoning <unk> for the empty glory of riding through Vienna . " 
 After the victory at <unk> , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned <unk> . However disappointed he may have been with <unk> , Napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " the immortal Battle of <unk> " , <unk> received the Officer 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor . 
 The loss of <unk> was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization . Called out of retirement for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff officers , other than the <unk> Charles . From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Army , the Lower Rhine , the Rhine and the Army of Germany . Furthermore , he was a trusted member of <unk> Charles ' staff . He had helped to design several of Charles ' more important victories at <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> , the battles at <unk> and <unk> , and the northern Swiss Campaign of <unk> that included battles at <unk> and <unk> . An experienced officer and excellent <unk> , he might well have made a more effective Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of <unk> than his eventual replacement , Franz von <unk> . In <unk> 's absence <unk> , the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at <unk> in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at <unk> . <unk> , undoubtedly a far better <unk> than <unk> , and possessed of superior training and mapping skills , would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for <unk> . <unk> 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory , but it would have <unk> the magnitude of the Coalition 's losses ; <unk> was considered one of Napoleon 's finest <unk> . 
 In the broader picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was determined on the Continent , predominantly in the two major land operations . In the Ulm campaign , the Habsburgs achieved some minor victories , such as <unk> 's at <unk> @-@ <unk> , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as <unk> out of retirement . After the capitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian military <unk> capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out of the <unk> and joined <unk> 's force . A few other small forces refused to <unk> and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the <unk> forests , to reappear in Bohemia for <unk> . Sixteen hundred cavalry , including <unk> Ferdinand and Prince <unk> , broke out of Ulm before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of <unk> , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> . These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French . Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at <unk> , there were other minor achievements : a successful <unk> between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of <unk> , the contested victory at <unk> , and another within days at <unk> . 
 The second determining event , the decisive French victory at the Battle of <unk> over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition . The subsequent Peace of <unk> , signed on 26 December 1805 , reinforced the earlier treaties of <unk> <unk> and <unk> . Furthermore , Austria ceded land to Napoleon 's German allies , and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs . Victory at <unk> also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a <unk> zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia , Russia , and Austria . These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent . Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 , in which Austria did not participate .

 Until 1805 , <unk> was probably best known as the village in which crusader Richard the <unk> was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . In 1741 , during the War of the Austrian <unk> , several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force . 
 After 1805 , the exploits of 40 @,@ 000 French , Russian , and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination . General <unk> 's grave has never been found , but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor , the gate leading from the old village of <unk> to the hamlet of Stein . The house in which Captain von <unk> lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . In 1840 , a Spanish <unk> created an image of the battle , which was later expanded by English <unk> John <unk> . The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the <unk> flotilla ( see <unk> image ) on a <unk> night . In fact , the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image . 
 In 1836 , Jean Antoine <unk> Fort ( French , 1793 – 1861 ) , a historical painter , created a <unk> of the battle , Combat de <unk> le 11 <unk> 1805 ( ( English ) Battle of <unk> of 11 November 1805 ) , which is in the <unk> collection at Versailles . 
 In the Russian novel War and Peace , Leo <unk> devoted several pages to the battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by Prince Andrew . Between <unk> and <unk> , at the edge of the <unk> plain , stands the " Little Frenchman " memorial ( see image ) erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle ; it bears the names of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others on a copper @-@ engraved plate .

 On April 29 , 2006 , after the final match of the K @-@ 1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Las Vegas , <unk> announced his intent to join K @-@ 1 's mixed martial arts league , Hero 's . He trained with Minnesota Martial Arts Academy under Greg Nelson and Minnesota Assistant Head wrestling coach Marty Morgan . <unk> announced on August 12 in Las Vegas that he had signed a deal with the K @-@ 1 promotion . His first fight was scheduled against <unk> Hong @-@ man of Korea on June 2 , 2007 , at the K @-@ 1 <unk> ! ! USA show . However , prior to the match , Hong @-@ Man was replaced by <unk> <unk> Kim . <unk> submitted <unk> Kim with strikes in 1 : 09 of the first round to win his first official <unk> match .

 During <unk> 77 , it was announced that <unk> had reached a deal to fight with the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( <unk> ) . On February 2 , 2008 , <unk> made his debut with the promotion in an event titled <unk> 81 : Breaking Point against former <unk> Heavyweight Champion , Frank <unk> . Due to his large hands , <unk> was wearing <unk> gloves for the fight , making him the second man in Nevada 's combat sports history to wear such gloves after <unk> Hong @-@ man . <unk> secured an early <unk> and began landing numerous <unk> but was docked a point after a punch hit <unk> on the back of the head . Following another <unk> by <unk> , <unk> managed to secure a <unk> and force a submission at 1 : 30 of the first round and <unk> lost in his <unk> debut . At <unk> 82 , former <unk> Heavyweight Champion and Hall of Famer Mark Coleman was announced to fight <unk> at <unk> 87 . However , Coleman withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Heath <unk> . <unk> defeated <unk> by unanimous decision . 
 <unk> would then face Randy <unk> for the <unk> Heavyweight Championship at <unk> 91 on November 15 . <unk> would beat <unk> via a technical knockout ( TKO ) in the second round to become the new <unk> Heavyweight Champion . 
 On December 27 , 2008 , at <unk> 92 , Frank <unk> defeated <unk> <unk> for the Interim Heavyweight Championship and was to face <unk> for the <unk> <unk> Heavyweight Championship at <unk> 98 . Immediately after winning the Interim Heavyweight title , <unk> found <unk> in the crowd and shouted , " You 've got my belt " . Due to a knee injury to <unk> , the title unification match with <unk> that was originally slated to be the <unk> 98 main event was postponed . <unk> won the postponed rematch with <unk> at <unk> 100 on July 11 , 2009 , via technical knockout in the second round . The win earned <unk> <unk> of the Year honors , with Anderson Silva , from <unk> for 2009 . During his post @-@ match celebration , <unk> flipped off the crowd who had been <unk> him . <unk> also made a disparaging comment about the pay @-@ per @-@ view 's primary sponsor <unk> Light , claiming they " won 't pay me <unk> ' " and promoted <unk> Light instead . <unk> later apologized for his remarks at the post @-@ fight press conference , where he held a bottle of <unk> Light and endorsed their product . 
 On July 1 , 2009 , it was reported that the winner of the Shane <unk> vs. Cain <unk> fight at <unk> 104 would face <unk> but the match was scrapped and <unk> was scheduled to defend his belt against Shane <unk> at <unk> 106 on November 21 . On October 26 , 2009 , it was announced that <unk> pulled out of his <unk> bout due to an illness . <unk> President Dana White said <unk> had been ill for three weeks , claiming he had never been this sick in his life and that it would take him a while to recover ; his fight with <unk> was <unk> for <unk> 108 on January 2 , 2010 . <unk> initially sought treatment in Canada , but later told reporters that he had received " Third World treatment " at a hospital in Brandon , Manitoba , and that seeking better treatment in the U.S. saved his life . <unk> went on to criticize Canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience in an effort to speak " on the behalf of the doctors in the United States that don 't want health care reform to happen " . 
 On November 4 , it was confirmed that <unk> was suffering from <unk> and that his bout with <unk> would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for <unk> 's heavyweight championship was cancelled . On November 14 , at the <unk> 105 post @-@ fight conference , Dana White stated , " [ <unk> ] ' s not well and he 's not going to be getting well <unk> soon " and that an interim title match might need to be set up . In addition to <unk> , it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of <unk> , an intestinal disorder , which required surgery . After further diagnosis , <unk> underwent surgery on November 16 to close a <unk> in his intestine that had been leaking <unk> matter into his abdomen , causing pain , <unk> , and <unk> his immune system to the point that he contracted <unk> . From the level of damage to <unk> 's system , the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year . 
 In January 2010 , <unk> announced on ESPN 's <unk> that he was scheduled to make a return to the <unk> in the summer . A match between Frank <unk> and Shane <unk> took place on March 27 at <unk> 111 to determine the Interim Heavyweight Champion , and <unk> 's next opponent . Shane <unk> defeated <unk> via knockout in the first round , becoming the new Interim Champion . After the fight , <unk> came into the ring and stated , " It was a good fight but he 's wearing a belt that 's a make @-@ believe belt . I 've got the real championship belt " . <unk> faced <unk> at <unk> 116 to <unk> the heavyweight titles . Early in the first round , <unk> knocked <unk> down with punch , gave him a cut above his left eye , and used a ground and pound attack the rest of the round . In the next round , <unk> was able to take <unk> down , attain a full mount , then move into side @-@ control and finish the fight with an arm triangle <unk> . With the victory , <unk> became the <unk> <unk> Heavyweight Champion , earning his first <unk> of the Night and giving <unk> his first loss . The win also tied a <unk> record for most consecutive successful Heavyweight Championship defenses . 
 <unk> 's next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain <unk> on October 23 , at the Honda Center in <unk> , California at <unk> 121 . Dana White announced via <unk> that the <unk> would bring back <unk> Primetime to hype the fight . He was defeated by <unk> for the title by TKO in the first round . 
 On January 11 , 2011 , <unk> was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13 , opposite Junior dos Santos , with the two expected to fight on June 11 at <unk> 131 , however , he was struck with another bout of <unk> and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12 . He was replaced by Shane <unk> , who ended up losing against dos Santos . <unk> underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with <unk> . Dana White said that he had a 12 @-@ inch piece of his <unk> removed . 
 In its May 2011 issue , ESPN 's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports . <unk> topped the list for <unk> at $ 5 @.@ 3 million , which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay @-@ per @-@ view bonuses . 
 In the summer of 2011 , <unk> announced that he was returning to action , stating , " I feel like a new man . <unk> . Strong . I feel like I used to feel " . His return match was scheduled to be at <unk> 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former <unk> heavyweight champion <unk> <unk> . <unk> won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round . The result of the fight remains controversial , as <unk> tested positive for elevated levels of <unk> prior to his next fight . <unk> then announced his retirement from <unk> , mentioning his struggles with <unk> and saying " tonight was the last time you 'll see me in the <unk> " . 
 <unk> about a return to <unk> lasted until March 24 , 2015 , when <unk> announced in an interview on <unk> that he had re @-@ signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to <unk> , even though he was offered a deal " ten times more " than what he had made previously in his <unk> career . He further elaborated that , while he was training for months for a return to the <unk> , he felt " physically great but something was lacking mentally " . <unk> added that " [ he 's ] an older <unk> now , so [ he ] makes <unk> <unk> decisions " and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to <unk> because he could " work part @-@ time with full @-@ time pay " .

 Though <unk> said he was " closing the door on <unk> " in March 2015 , <unk> announced on June 4 , 2016 , that he would return at <unk> 200 on July 9 . WWE confirmed it had granted <unk> " a one @-@ off opportunity " to compete at <unk> 200 before he would return to the company for SummerSlam on August 21 . 
 <unk> , representing Canada for the first time in his career , defeated Mark Hunt by unanimous decision ( 29 @-@ 27 ) , avoiding 19 of Hunt 's 30 attempted standing strikes , and taking him down four times to land 43 significant ground strikes , 32 in the final round . He also won a <unk> @-@ record $ 2 @.@ 5 million <unk> . 
 On July 15 , <unk> was notified of a potential anti @-@ doping policy violation by the United States Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( <unk> ) stemming from an undisclosed banned substance in an out @-@ of @-@ competition sample collected on June 28 . Shortly after this was announced , WWE said <unk> 's match with Randy <unk> at SummerSlam would still take place . Hunt told <unk> to either pay him half of <unk> 's <unk> or let him out of his contract . He later changed his mind on Twitter , and asked for the whole <unk> . <unk> has not yet publicly responded to Hunt . <unk> told the Associated Press , " We will get to the bottom of this . " On July 19 , the <unk> announced that a second sample taken in @-@ competition on July 9 tested positive for the same banned substance discovered in the previous out @-@ of @-@ competition sample .

 = Constant k filter = 
 
 Constant k <unk> , also k @-@ type <unk> , are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method . They are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Constant k <unk> were invented by George Campbell . He published his work in 1922 , but had clearly invented the <unk> some time before , as his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto <unk> , was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell 's <unk> were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . Campbell called his <unk> electric wave <unk> , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them . 
 The great advantage Campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> circuit and other simple <unk> of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of transition between pass band and stop band . It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained . 
 The <unk> were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded . However , the ladder <unk> used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with <unk> of modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter . Campbell gave constant k designs for low @-@ pass , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> . Band @-@ stop and multiple band <unk> are also possible . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 Some of the <unk> terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections , and in the case of the <unk> being discussed , an infinite ladder network of L @-@ sections . Here " L " should not be confused with the <unk> L – in electronic filter <unk> , " L " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " L " . 
 The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having <unk> <unk> and <unk> elements with <unk> <unk> . The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience , since it is usual to work in terms of half @-@ sections where it disappears . The image <unk> of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same . However , for a mid @-@ series section ( that is , a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element ) will have the same image <unk> on both ports due to symmetry . This image <unk> is designated <unk> due to the " T " <unk> of a mid @-@ series section . Likewise , the image <unk> of a mid @-@ <unk> section is designated <unk> due to the " <unk> " <unk> . Half of such a " T " or " <unk> " section is called a half @-@ section , which is also an L @-@ section but with half the element values of the full L @-@ section . The image <unk> of the half @-@ section is <unk> on the input and output ports : on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series <unk> , but on the side presenting the <unk> element it is equal to the mid @-@ <unk> <unk> . There are thus two variant ways of using a half @-@ section . 
 Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex <unk> representation of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The building block of constant k <unk> is the half @-@ section " L " network , composed of a series <unk> Z , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> The " k " in " constant k " is the value given by , 
 <formula> 
 Thus , k will have units of <unk> , that is , <unk> . It is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant , Y must be the dual <unk> of Z. A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of <unk> as the size of the section ( in terms of values of its components , such as <unk> , <unk> , etc . ) approaches zero , while keeping k at its initial value . Thus , k is the characteristic <unk> , <unk> , of the transmission line that would be formed by these <unk> small sections . It is also the image <unk> of the section at resonance , in the case of band @-@ pass <unk> , or at <unk> = 0 in the case of low @-@ pass <unk> . For example , the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section has 
 <formula> . 
 Elements L and C can be made <unk> small while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both approaching zero , and from the formulae ( below ) for image <unk> , 
 <formula> .

 The image <unk> of the section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and 
 <formula> 
 Given that the filter does not contain any <unk> elements , the image <unk> in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section , 
 <formula> 
 The transition occurs at a cut @-@ off frequency given by 
 <formula> 
 Below this frequency , the image <unk> is real , 
 <formula> 
 Above the cut @-@ off frequency the image <unk> is imaginary ,

 The transmission parameters for a general constant k half @-@ section are given by

 and for a chain of n half @-@ sections 
 <formula> 
 For the low @-@ pass L @-@ shape section , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by 
 <formula> 
 That is , the transmission is <unk> in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are : 
 <formula> 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 The presented plots of image <unk> , <unk> and phase change correspond to a low @-@ pass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency of <unk> 
 = 1 <unk> / s and a nominal <unk> k = 
 1 <unk> . This is produced by a filter half @-@ section with <unk> L 
 = 1 <unk> and <unk> C = 
 1 <unk> . This prototype can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> sections = = 
 
 Several L @-@ shape half @-@ sections may be <unk> to form a composite filter . Like <unk> must always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L @-@ shaped half @-@ sections . Where a port of image <unk> <unk> faces another <unk> , the section is called a <unk> section . Where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a T section . Further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or <unk> elements . 
 It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image <unk> . This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections .

 " The <unk> " is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul <unk> . 
 The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of <unk> Madame <unk> ( Neve <unk> ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( <unk> Stewart ) and <unk> <unk> ( Dan <unk> ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , " The Angels Take Manhattan " . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient <unk> that are building themselves and meets <unk> Oswald ( Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman ) , a governess also investigating the <unk> . They discover that the <unk> are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian <unk> ) with the help of a man named Dr <unk> ( Richard E. Grant ) . 
 Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in " Asylum of the <unk> " , " The <unk> " introduces <unk> as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to <unk> , " The <unk> " also introduces a redesigned <unk> , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9 @.@ 87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most @-@ watched programme of Christmas Day . " The <unk> " was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of <unk> well . However , some felt that Grant and <unk> were <unk> as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation .

 To promote the special , three <unk> were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need <unk> on 16 November 2012 , titled " The Great Detective " . The <unk> Madame <unk> , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the <unk> <unk> ( all returning from " A Good Man Goes to War " ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . 
 A second prequel , titled " <unk> <unk> " , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , <unk> and Jenny <unk> with an officer from Scotland Yard and <unk> for <unk> 's violent wishes for the <unk> 's punishment . <unk> explains <unk> 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his <unk> . <unk> reveals that she was <unk> by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and <unk> notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky . 
 A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon 's Run — Two Days Later " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of " A Good Man Goes to War " , <unk> and Jenny convince <unk> that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how <unk> was resurrected and came to be in <unk> 's employ .

He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow @-@ filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated <unk> . The Doctor , still <unk> after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his <unk> above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies <unk> , Jenny , and <unk> to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . 
 Elsewhere , <unk> <unk> <unk> Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , but <unk> follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs <unk> to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of <unk> 's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by <unk> created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that <unk> 's thoughts are creating the <unk> and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . <unk> <unk> the Doctor that if he <unk> her memory , she will forget how to deal with the <unk> . The Doctor <unk> allows her to go and <unk> a staircase to the sky to return to the <unk> . <unk> follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . <unk> returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain <unk> . She learns that <unk> 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead . <unk> realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see <unk> . <unk> tells <unk> she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . <unk> chooses the word " Pond " , which <unk> the Doctor and <unk> his interest . 
 Acting on a tip from <unk> , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr. <unk> and find a large glass globe in <unk> 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr. <unk> since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the <unk> and has taken interest in <unk> 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and <unk> that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNA <unk> to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While <unk> is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by <unk> , Jenny and <unk> . Dr. <unk> arrives with more <unk> and tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with <unk> to the roof of the mansion and then to the <unk> <unk> overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the <unk> the Doctor gives <unk> a <unk> key , but the ice governess arrives and pulls <unk> down off the cloud . 
 The Doctor picks up <unk> and takes her back to <unk> 's mansion , placing her under medical care of <unk> . He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a <unk> London Underground <unk> tin . He and <unk> travel to <unk> 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr <unk> <unk> the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which <unk> on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr <unk> 's thoughts , will vanish with the <unk> of <unk> 's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control <unk> 's body , which it uses to attack <unk> and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly <unk> , and <unk> falls dead . Outside , a salt @-@ water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the <unk> family , crying for <unk> . <unk> informs the Doctor upon his return to the <unk> mansion that <unk> only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the <unk> key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads <unk> 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in " Asylum of the <unk> " who became a <unk> , whom he refers to as " <unk> Girl " . He <unk> announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the <unk> to investigate and find <unk> . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling <unk> walks through the same graveyard , <unk> by <unk> 's tombstone .

 The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The <unk> <unk> ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot <unk> as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The <unk> " when he presents the London Underground <unk> tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr <unk> 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do not understand these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly setting in motion ) the future <unk> attack on London via the Underground . 
 Coleman previously played <unk> Oswald in " Asylum of the <unk> " , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until <unk> reveals she has an interest in <unk> , a trait that <unk> 's character also had . The Doctor , after meeting <unk> , <unk> replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tells Craig <unk> ( " <unk> Time " ) when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins . The final scenes at the graveyard establish that <unk> shares the same name as <unk> , leading the Doctor to <unk> they are the same person . As seen on her gravestone , <unk> 's <unk> is 23 November , the date Doctor Who was first transmitted in 1963 .

 Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed <unk> — I want to be on my own for a while ' . " Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor ( William <unk> ) in 1963 and the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " The <unk> " was promoted like a movie . A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and <unk> ascending the ladder to the <unk> . 
 The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The <unk> " is the debut of a redesigned <unk> interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor 's face , the first time since Survival , the final serial of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the <unk> ' design was getting " progressively whimsical " and resembled more of a " magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael <unk> , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and <unk> " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship when shooting . 
 The Doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume , Victorian @-@ themed , which Smith described as " a bit <unk> <unk> meets the Doctor " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his life now " and felt more " grown @-@ up " and <unk> . The costume was designed by Howard <unk> for this episode . " The <unk> " also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is co @-@ creator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme . 
 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 
 This episode marks the return of Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman , who previously appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the <unk> " . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . She auditioned for the role of <unk> , not <unk> from " Asylum " , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for <unk> . The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the Doctor . Smith said that <unk> was different from her predecessor Amy Pond ( Karen <unk> ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers . The <unk> who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , " The Bells of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The <unk> " . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a payoff " to her mystery . 
 Also returning to the series are Neve <unk> as Madame <unk> , Dan <unk> as <unk> and <unk> Stewart as Jenny . All three previously appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the <unk> . They returned due to the popularity of <unk> and Jenny ; Moffat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . Instead , he decided to bring them back in the main series . Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions , as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of <unk> Death , which was written by Moffat and as an alternative <unk> Doctor in the animated story Scream of the <unk> which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005 . Smith commented that Grant was " born to be a Who villain . He pitches it on that perfect level and tone " . Grant 's appearance in Doctor Who was <unk> by the BBC via Twitter , announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 . Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme . The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian <unk> . The two children <unk> is governess to , <unk> and <unk> , were played by real @-@ life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie <unk> @-@ Alden .

 " The <unk> " was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special . The read @-@ through had taken place on 2 August 2012 . This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales ' new <unk> Lock studios . Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square , Bristol , where filming took place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 . Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian @-@ era architecture . <unk> stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub , which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in Oxford . The locations were blocked off and <unk> with fake snow . 
 The <unk> on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects . Director Saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the <unk> ; the first ones he likened to <unk> from Rainbow which was too " cute " of an appearance , and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces . <unk> 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects for the show . The first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior , with the implication of the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience . In the following shot , the camera does a complete circle of the <unk> console , an effect not seen since the early days of the show . <unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger on the inside than the outside " nature of the time machine . 
 In addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional promotional video , " <unk> <unk> , " which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . The video featured <unk> singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as <unk> as his <unk> look on , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Dan Martin of The Guardian called it " actually the best Christmas Special since ' The Christmas Invasion ' " and the first to be " actually scary " , with " everything we like " about Doctor Who and Christmas . He praised Coleman 's introduction as <unk> and the gang of <unk> , Jenny , and <unk> . IGN 's Matt <unk> gave " The <unk> " a score of 9 @.@ 4 out of 10 , describing it as " a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in storytelling " which " refreshingly " lacked traditional Christmas references " in favour of some sparkling dialogue , gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation " . While he felt that Grant and <unk> were <unk> , he was very positive towards Coleman 's " unpredictable " <unk> . Radio Times reviewer Patrick <unk> was pleased with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found , and praised the " lovely images " and direction of the special , though he felt the variation of the theme music " lacks the menace " of the original . While he was positive towards <unk> , he was " <unk> by her death " as it was " plainly silly " that she did not look injured . 
 Nick <unk> of <unk> gave the special four and a half out of five stars , writing that " the power of emotion saves the day again " was appropriate in light of the festivities and many <unk> referenced in the story . <unk> was positive towards the " terrific " comedy with <unk> , Coleman and the " surprisingly <unk> " Grant , as well as the new title sequence and <unk> . While he wrote that the subtle <unk> of the Great Intelligence was " a <unk> more interesting than the usual ' So , we meet again ! ' <unk> " , he ultimately felt their threat " never quite comes into sharp relief " . <unk> <unk> of The Independent wrote that " The <unk> " was stronger than the previous year 's " The Doctor , the Widow , and the <unk> " as it was connected to the overall story of the series , but " still has a way to go if it is to live up to ' A Christmas Carol ' " . Despite feeling that it was " enjoyable " , she noted that " the story feels truncated and rushed " 
 The Mirror 's Jon Cooper also praised Coleman and the new side of the Doctor that was shown , comparing it to Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) challenging the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) . However , he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> of the plot , which was " a classic Who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation [ and ] more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole " . He felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers , but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary . Dominic <unk> of The Daily Telegraph gave " The <unk> " three out of five stars , disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been <unk> to be . While he was positive towards Smith and the <unk> on the cloud , he criticised <unk> and the " <unk> @-@ like complexity " of the script . 
 The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) , alongside " Asylum of the <unk> " and " The Angels Take Manhattan " , but lost to the Game of <unk> episode " <unk> " .

 No. 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) support squadron . Coming under the control of No. 96 Wing , it is responsible for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . The squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during World War II . <unk> in August 1941 , it operated <unk> <unk> and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea , Queensland and the Northern Territory , conducting search @-@ and @-@ rescue , mine @-@ laying , anti @-@ submarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the conclusion of hostilities , the squadron was disbanded in March 1946 . It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015 .

 No. 20 Squadron was formed at Port Moresby , New Guinea , on 1 August 1941 for a general reconnaissance role , under the command of Squadron Leader <unk> Gibson . Its establishment was six <unk> <unk> flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft ( all transferred from No. 11 Squadron ) and 55 personnel were available initially . The squadron conducted long @-@ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia 's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron . On 18 November , No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron . 
 On 25 November 1941 , following the loss of <unk> Sydney , one of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No. 11 Squadron <unk> in search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions , but they found only oil <unk> . By the outbreak of war in the Pacific , No. 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catalinas and two Empire flying boats . Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men . The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December ; a <unk> located three Japanese <unk> in the vicinity of Thursday Island , Queensland . Later in the month it commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids against Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No. 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's Australian defenders before being shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire ; it was the squadron 's first combat loss . 
 In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catalinas of Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons became the RAAF 's only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , and in the following months Port Moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In February 1942 , the Short <unk> operated by Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No. 33 ( Transport ) Squadron . No. 20 Squadron lost two Catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace . 
 In response to the threat of invasion at Port Moresby , Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons moved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae , <unk> and Rabaul . On 27 June , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @-@ hour raid over Lae and <unk> during which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between a <unk> whistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No. 20 Squadron 's strength was six Catalinas and 175 personnel , out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel . Its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around New Guinea . Between December 1942 and March 1943 , No. 20 Squadron 's aircraft flew a total of 9 @,@ <unk> hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs . The squadron 's role changed in June 1943 when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops . 
 In September 1944 , No. 20 Squadron became part of No. 76 Wing RAAF , along with Nos. 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to Darwin , Northern Territory . All three squadrons operated Catalinas , their primary purpose being mine @-@ laying . On the night of 30 September , a <unk> of No. 20 Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at <unk> in the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the <unk> of the mining campaign , Lieutenant Commander <unk> Carr of the Royal Australian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Another of the squadron 's Catalinas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over the Timor Sea , during the campaign to mine <unk> . In March , a detachment of four No. 20 Squadron aircraft , along with four from No. 43 Squadron , laid mines off the coast of southern China and <unk> as part of a No. 76 Wing offensive in this area ; these operations were conducted from <unk> Gulf in the Philippines . One of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was lost on the night of 7 / 8 March , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . Three of the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catalinas mined <unk> harbour in China , the <unk> north that any Australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the Pacific . Three of its aircraft flew the RAAF 's last mine @-@ laying mission on 30 July . 
 No. 20 Squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Following the end of the war , the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried Australian prisoners of war home from various locations in South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station <unk> , New South Wales , on 21 November . No. 20 Squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to <unk> , on 21 January 1946 , and disbanded at <unk> on 27 March .

 No. 20 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . <unk> of nine <unk> personnel and one Australian Public Service member under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing , a component of Combat Support Group ( <unk> ) . The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of <unk> Operational Support Group , but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that , in common with other RAAF airfields , it should be administered by <unk> . RAAF Base <unk> , incorporating <unk> Village , was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the <unk> Range Complex , the other unit being RAAF <unk> Test Range . 
 The design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility , a <unk> spear <unk> to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , Sturt 's Desert <unk> to represent South Australia , and the <unk> star cluster , which features in the folklore of the local <unk> people . 
 
 
 = Light Tank Mk VII <unk> = 
 
 The Light Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , also known as the <unk> , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @-@ <unk> in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II . The <unk> was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army . It improved upon its predecessor , the Mk <unk> Light Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2 @-@ pounder gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced . 
 The tank 's design flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use of <unk> in the North African Campaign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> program . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with <unk> . In May 1942 , a small number of <unk> formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , <unk> were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support British airborne forces . The <unk> were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft <unk> gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . 
 The division used approximately 20 <unk> during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost in accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support . By August 1944 , most of the <unk> in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the <unk> <unk> in December 1944 . 
 <unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several variations on the <unk> design , including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army .

 = = = Initial development = = = 
 
 The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , nicknamed ' <unk> ' , was first developed in 1937 by Vickers @-@ <unk> as a private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company . The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . Vickers @-@ Armstrong installed on the Mk <unk> a 2 @-@ pounder 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) main gun paired with a 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) <unk> machine gun , and mounted the two guns in a two @-@ man turret . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) of armour . The prototype weighed approximately 16 @,@ 800 pounds ( 7 @,@ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @-@ horsepower ( 123 kW ) Meadows engine . <unk> was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate driver or <unk> wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed . The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models . The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by <unk> the tracks . For sharper turns , the system returned to the conventional method of <unk> one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the <unk> and reduce its power <unk> . The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for <unk> and <unk> of oil for <unk> , and each of the wheels was independently sprung . 
 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some <unk> to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave the <unk> the official General Staff specification number <unk> , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range . 
 
 = = = Production = = = 
 
 The number to be produced was subject to <unk> as the War Office <unk> in their demand ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @-@ day conference in November . Production was to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 . The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan <unk> Carriage and <unk> , a company part owned by Vickers @-@ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks . 
 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities . Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled . 
 The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk <unk> ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name ' <unk> ' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year . 
 
 = = = Transfer to airborne role = = = 
 
 The War Office and the Army were concluding , at this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the <unk> was considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat . 
 The demise of <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid @-@ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility of a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft <unk> , currently under development , would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two Universal <unk> . The <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces . 
 Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of the <unk> Pilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the <unk> , over 2 @,@ 800 <unk> were made with an average of 50 <unk> per crew . Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . When the <unk> was re @-@ designated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) infantry support howitzer ; these tanks were then designated as <unk> 1 <unk> ( Close Support ) . Additionally , <unk> <unk> were added to those <unk> which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration . 
 The <unk> experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces . One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces . The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the <unk> @-@ <unk> Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation <unk> , the invasion of Madagascar . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 <unk> were available for use . In a memorandum , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F. <unk> , commander of the 1st Airborne Division , <unk> complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a War Office report that some <unk> airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the <unk> 's eventual replacement by the US <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = Performance = = 
 
 A number of design faults of the <unk> were revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as <unk> for the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost impossible . 
 Problems were also found with the <unk> <unk> fitted to the 2 @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the <unk> could not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture . 
 The War Office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service in <unk> climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .

 The first <unk> were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division . However , the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service . 
 The <unk> remained in Britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation Barbarossa began , and the USSR became an ally of Britain . The <unk> @-@ <unk> program , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China , was therefore extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , included a shipment of 20 <unk> , as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks . The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use the <unk> . When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally , the cold weather had a <unk> effect on the tank 's suspension and tracks . Additional testing of the <unk> was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its <unk> , <unk> , and speed , as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel , unlike contemporary Soviet designs . The <unk> of the <unk> 's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed . Despite these drawbacks in the <unk> 's design , Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T @-@ 70 light tank in use at the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat . A number of <unk> were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the <unk> <unk> Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat , one on 30 September and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of artillery fire . Several were also used for propaganda purposes , appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the <unk> region . 
 
 = = = Operation <unk> = = = 
 
 In mid @-@ 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark <unk> light tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate . All three squadrons were transported to <unk> in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and <unk> from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six <unk> , formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force was <unk> to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred . These fears proved <unk> , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training . 
 The next assignment , Operation <unk> , was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then under <unk> French control . The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of <unk> to Japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean . Operation <unk> was under the command of Major General Robert G. <unk> and consisted of No. 5 Commando , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division . The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations , and under its command was ' B ' Special Service Squadron , created by <unk> six <unk> from ' B ' Squadron and six <unk> from ' C ' Squadron into a single unit . The squadron was formed into four troops , one Headquarters troop of three <unk> and one <unk> , one of four <unk> , and two formed from the remaining five <unk> . The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May , near <unk> and the bay of Diego <unk> . The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , which would allow the British forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach <unk> from the rear . Information about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and the <unk> French defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank . 
 The landings began at 04 : 30 on 5 May , with 5 Commando landing at <unk> Bay and the three infantry brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing at <unk> Bay . The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of <unk> and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' B ' Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a <unk> came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand . The infantry brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron , but eventually two <unk> and a single <unk> were dispatched in support , catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of <unk> . Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences , consisting of camouflaged trenches and <unk> dug in along a ridge . The tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky ground made <unk> difficult and they could not close with the <unk> and trenches ; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine @-@ gun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day . The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two other <unk> dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the <unk> French main line of defence . This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged <unk> , machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ in 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed for an anti @-@ tank role , could penetrate the armour of both the <unk> and the <unk> . The two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two <unk> that were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the third <unk> retreated in order to report on the French resistance , machine <unk> a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back . 
 The commander of the <unk> made his report , and was then ordered to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed . The remaining tanks exchanged several <unk> of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , two <unk> and three <unk> , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the <unk> French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade .

 Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @-@ 1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation <unk> , was conducted by a <unk> Commando unit . By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using <unk> ; it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles . The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour . 
 On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was re @-@ designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two <unk> , the Mark 1 <unk> variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light Tank Squadron , also known as ' A ' Squadron , received the majority of the <unk> . ' A ' Squadron had approximately nineteen <unk> split between six troops , two of which were of the <unk> variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with <unk> <unk> . On 24 May 1944 , after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at <unk> <unk> airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF <unk> Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The operation began on the night of 5 June , with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied <unk> landings , securing strategically important areas east of Caen , capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River <unk> , and destroying a coastal artillery battery . <unk> transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day . Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th <unk> Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade . Therefore , Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not <unk> gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th <unk> Brigade to land in the second lift . 
 The <unk> and <unk> gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The <unk> of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the <unk> broke loose of its <unk> and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the <unk> they carried ; a third <unk> hit another <unk> as it was being <unk> and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their <unk> , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding <unk> . 
 The squadron retrieved all of the remaining <unk> and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the <unk> de <unk> area and conduct reconnaissance duties . After linking with the battalion , the squadron began <unk> , and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered . By the end of 7 June , two <unk> had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a German self @-@ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine . The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . At this time , Gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging the <unk> with German armour , as they proved to be completely <unk> by the German tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , such as the Panzer IV and the <unk> III . Instead , when the division required armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and the <unk> were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the division 's preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority of <unk> in ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three <unk> remained , assigned to the Headquarters troop of ' A ' Squadron .

 Operation Tonga was the last that <unk> saw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive <unk> , in which it was completely <unk> , and all the remaining <unk> were retired . They were replaced with the <unk> <unk> , a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank of American design ; eight <unk> were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation <unk> , the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A report issued by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the <unk> design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in post @-@ war airborne formations would be entirely new in design . A small number of <unk> remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a <unk> glider flight was stationed at RAF <unk> , and a troop of <unk> was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders . However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the <unk> withdrawn from service .

 There were several variants of the <unk> design . The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , Vickers @-@ Armstrong 's proposed successor to the <unk> . The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins , named after President Roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the General Staff design number <unk> by the War Office . The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the <unk> in a number of areas . It had thicker armour than the <unk> , with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help <unk> shells fired at the tank . The dimensions of the <unk> were also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and heavier . The new tank was no longer air @-@ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk> . The 12 @-@ cylinder engine of the <unk> was fitted to the Mark VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its armament also remained the same as that of the <unk> . The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941 . The new design was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @,@ 000 to be constructed in September . However , problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems . These problems continued to persist into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; approximately 100 Mark <unk> were produced by 1945 , when production ended . 
 A second variant on the <unk> design was the <unk> <unk> Drive ( " <unk> DD " ) . The <unk> Drive system was invented by Nicholas <unk> , and was designed to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and participate in amphibious operations . The system functioned by <unk> a large <unk> canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirty @-@ six <unk> tubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank sufficient <unk> to float , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . The system was fitted during June 1941 , as the <unk> was the lightest light tank available at the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs , allowing the <unk> Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks , such as the Valentine . The system would be used during Operation <unk> , when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches .

 <unk> , known in Japan as I Love Donald Duck : Georgia <unk> no <unk> ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> ) , is a 1991 <unk> video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis . The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 . <unk> stars Donald Duck and his three nephews , Huey , <unk> , and <unk> , as treasure @-@ hunters , and is part of a series of games published by Sega that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters . 
 <unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as " some of the best graphics around . " The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However , <unk> was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as " float @-@ y " and making certain segments of the game <unk> difficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had .

 The player , as Donald , ventures through a variety of side @-@ scrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides . Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the <unk> outside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' biplane , and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return . 
 Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot <unk> , popcorn or bubble gum . Donald has unlimited <unk> which can only temporarily <unk> enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with <unk> ) , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from <unk> <unk> . Later in the game , the <unk> is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to traverse longer distances . In <unk> , India and Egypt , Donald can also pick up <unk> <unk> which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become <unk> , increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path .

 While Donald is <unk> through some books in <unk> <unk> 's library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King <unk> , ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times . The map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his death . Donald thinks this is his path to riches . Unfortunately Big Bad Pete <unk> and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure . 
 <unk> with his nephews Huey , <unk> , and <unk> , and using the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in <unk> , with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet <unk> " to obtain a " hero key " from an explorer back in <unk> to open the pyramid . Inside the pyramid , Donald meets <unk> , who gives him a strange note and a <unk> to help him reach higher places , and tells him that <unk> <unk> is looking for him back in <unk> . Travelling across the <unk> of <unk> to meet <unk> , Donald is given <unk> 's latest invention , <unk> <unk> that can break through walls . The last location on the partial map is Count <unk> 's castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map . 
 After defeating <unk> , Donald receives a more complete map . In India , Donald enters the palace of the <unk> , where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a <unk> <unk> . Donald succeeds and receives the <unk> <unk> , which is the key to open a temple in Egypt . Donald is able to solve the " <unk> of the <unk> " using the note <unk> had given him , and obtains the <unk> of Ra before escaping in a mine cart . From there , he journeys to the South Pole , where he finds a key frozen in ice , and uses the <unk> of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key . The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship , which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure . The ship is haunted by ghosts , and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them . After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior , Donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole , and gives him an " ancient Viking <unk> " that <unk> to flying creatures . Donald then returns to the South Pole , <unk> a ride on one of Pete 's bird <unk> to reach the diary . 
 However , upon finding the diary , Pete shows up , holding Donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary . After giving Pete the diary , Donald travels to Pete 's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back . The diary reveals that the map , when dipped in water , will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure . Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault . After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . When the disappointed Donald returns home , Huey , <unk> and <unk> accidentally break the statue , which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside . Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together .

 = <unk> colossal heads = 
 
 The <unk> colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the <unk> civilization of ancient <unk> . All portray mature men with <unk> <unk> , flat <unk> , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of <unk> and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual <unk> rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major <unk> centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear . 
 The discovery of a colossal head at <unk> <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of <unk> culture by Matthew <unk> in 1938 . Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone <unk> . An additional monument , at <unk> <unk> in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early <unk> period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone .

 The <unk> civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC . The <unk> <unk> lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within the states of Veracruz and <unk> , an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) inland from the coast . The <unk> are regarded as the first civilization to develop in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is one of six <unk> of civilization worldwide , the others being the <unk> <unk> culture of South America , the <unk> culture of China 's Yellow River , the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and the <unk> civilization of ancient Iraq . Of these , only the <unk> civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting . 
 The <unk> were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture . In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of <unk> writing , with the earliest examples of <unk> hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC . Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based on their similarity to other <unk> scripts . The evidence of complex society developing in the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being regarded as the " Mother Culture " of <unk> , although this concept remains controversial . 
 Some of the <unk> ' rulers seem to have served religious functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La <unk> in about 900 BC , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> de los <unk> possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear . Very fine <unk> art , much clearly made for an elite , survives in several forms , notably <unk> figurines , and larger sculptures such as The <unk> . The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population . Together with these , of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " <unk> @-@ style masks " in stone , so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an <unk> context . These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads . Two thirds of <unk> monumental sculpture represents the human form , and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of <unk> art .

 The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated . However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still . The heads from <unk> <unk> had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La <unk> were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium . Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most <unk> executed . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period of <unk> chronology , generally to the Early <unk> ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , although the two <unk> <unk> heads and the La <unk> Head are attributed to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) . 
 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 
 <unk> colossal heads vary in height from 1 @.@ 47 to 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . All of the <unk> colossal heads depict mature men with flat <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the <unk> region in modern times . The backs of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall . All examples of <unk> colossal heads wear distinctive <unk> that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are decorated with feathers . A head from La <unk> is decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities between the <unk> on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific <unk> may represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . Most of the heads wear large <unk> inserted into the ear lobes . 
 All of the heads are realistic , <unk> and <unk> descriptions of the men . It is likely that they were portraits of living ( or recently deceased ) rulers well known to the <unk> . Each head is distinct and <unk> , displaying <unk> features . They were once thought to represent <unk> although this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped for the <unk> <unk> . <unk> expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling . The most <unk> <unk> art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving <unk> , with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed . Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El <unk> demonstrate that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> sculptures than works sculpted from stone . 
 In the late nineteenth century , José <unk> y Serrano described a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and speculations that the <unk> had African origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van <unk> . Such speculation is not taken seriously by <unk> scholars such as Richard <unk> and Ann <unk> . 
 Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individual <unk> rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such resources . The workforce would have included <unk> , labourers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end . 
 Archaeological investigation of <unk> basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small <unk> of stone . The sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> , which were generally rounded <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . <unk> colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and <unk> . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . 
 All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the <unk> <unk> were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Most were formed from coarse <unk> dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a volcano in the range . <unk> have proposed that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments . These boulders are found in an area affected by large <unk> ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw material for <unk> the heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head . The stone for the San Lorenzo and La <unk> heads was transported a considerable distance from the source . The La <unk> head was found on El <unk> hill in the Sierra de los <unk> and the stone from <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 1 and <unk> <unk> Head 1 ( also known as <unk> <unk> Monuments A and Q ) came from the same hill . 
 The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the <unk> lacked <unk> of burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the <unk> transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depict <unk> rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the <unk> possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks . 
 The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental <unk> from which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen <unk> heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form for <unk> the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental <unk> <unk> and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .

 Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at <unk> <unk> in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in <unk> . <unk> colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with the <unk> style of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ <unk> , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the <unk> style of sculpture .

 The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ south across the site . Although some were recovered from <unk> , they were found close to their original <unk> and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , together with a number of monumental stone <unk> , probably formed a processional route across the site , powerfully displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 1 ) was lying facing upwards when excavated . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the <unk> site . <unk> Head 1 is 2 @.@ 84 metres ( 9 @.@ 3 ft ) high ; it measures 2 @.@ 11 metres ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) wide and it weighs 25 @.@ 3 tons . The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew <unk> in 1945 . When discovered it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines . The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase ( Late Classic period , 800 – 1000 AD ) . The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head . The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U @-@ shaped motif . This element descends across the front of the headdress , terminating on the forehead . On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs . The <unk> piece does not meet the horizontal band , leaving a space between the two pieces . On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear . The forehead is wrinkled in a <unk> . The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . The <unk> are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . The face is slightly asymmetric , which may be due to error on the part of the <unk> or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait 's subject . The head has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> ( " <unk> Museum of <unk> " ) . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 2 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 2 ) was reworked from a monumental throne . The head stands 2 @.@ 69 metres ( 8 @.@ 8 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 83 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 05 metres ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 20 tons . <unk> Head 2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew <unk> 's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it . The monument was found lying on its back , facing the sky , and was excavated in 1946 by <unk> and Philip <unk> . In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of " The <unk> tradition " exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963 . San Lorenzo <unk> Head 2 is currently in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the Early <unk> and Late Classic periods . <unk> Head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head ; this is decorated with three bird 's heads that are located above the forehead and temples . The <unk> piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head . The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain . Two short <unk> hang down from the headdress in front of the ears . The ear jewellery is formed by large <unk> <unk> or framed discs . The left and right ornaments are different , with radial lines on the left <unk> , a feature absent on the right <unk> . The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process . This process has <unk> the entire face with at least 60 smaller <unk> and 2 larger holes . The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead <unk> into a <unk> . The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @.@ 4 tons . The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew <unk> in 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . The headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal <unk> , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small <unk> tops the headdress . A large flap formed of four <unk> drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typically <unk> brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . <unk> Head 4 is 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high , 1 @.@ 17 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . The head was discovered by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a gully . When excavated , it was found to be lying on its right @-@ hand side and in a very good state of preservation . <unk> materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted <unk> , similar to those of Head 3 . On the right @-@ hand side , three <unk> descend from the upper portion of the headdress ; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band . These <unk> are judged to represent hair rather than <unk> . Also on the right hand side , two <unk> descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the left @-@ hand side , three vertical <unk> descend across the ear . The <unk> is only visible on the right hand side ; it is formed of a plain disc and <unk> . The face is that of an ageing man with a <unk> forehead , low <unk> and a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 . The monument stands 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 15 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . It weighs 11 @.@ 6 tons . The head was discovered by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound . The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location . <unk> recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases ( approximately 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD respectively ) . <unk> Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws ; this general identification of the decoration is contested by <unk> de la <unk> since the " paws " have three claws each ; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , ten <unk> strips form a net decorated with disc motifs . Two short <unk> descend from the headdress in front of the ears . The ears are adorned with disc @-@ shaped <unk> with <unk> . The face is that of an ageing man with <unk> under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose , and a forehead that is <unk> in a <unk> . The lips are slightly parted . <unk> Head 5 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 6 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 17 ) is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads , standing 1 @.@ 67 metres ( 5 @.@ 5 ft ) . It measures 1 @.@ 41 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons . The head was discovered by a local <unk> and was excavated in 1965 by Luis <unk> and <unk> <unk> Chan . The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side . In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum 's centenary exhibition . After its return to Mexico , it was placed in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . It is sculpted with a net @-@ like head covering joined together with sculpted beads . A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck . The <unk> is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear , extending around the entire head . A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear . The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back . The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> under the eyes , <unk> <unk> and deep <unk> on either side of the nose . The face is somewhat asymmetric , possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 7 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 53 ) measures 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 85 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) deep and weighs 18 tons . San Lorenzo <unk> Head 7 was reworked from a monumental throne ; it was discovered by a joint archaeological project by the <unk> <unk> de <unk> e Historia and Yale University , as a result of a <unk> survey . It was buried at a depth of less than 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) and was lying facing upwards , leaning slightly northwards on its right hand side . The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both from erosion and deliberate damage . The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands ; a feathered ornament is carved at the back of the <unk> and two discs adorn the front . A short strap descends from the <unk> and hangs in front of the right ear . The head sports large <unk> that completely cover the <unk> , although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish . The face has <unk> between the nose and <unk> , <unk> <unk> and deep @-@ set eyes ; the lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open , displaying the teeth . In 1986 the head was transported to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 8 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 61 ) stands 2 @.@ 2 metres ( 7 @.@ 2 ft ) high ; it measures 1 @.@ 65 metres ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) deep and weighs 13 tons . It is one of the finest examples of an <unk> colossal head . It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne . The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 metres ( 16 ft ) during a <unk> survey of the site in 1968 ; it has been dated to the Early <unk> . After discovery it was initially reburied ; it was moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> in 1986 . The headdress is decorated with the <unk> or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle . It has a <unk> and a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears . Two short <unk> descend in front of the ears . The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of <unk> . The face is that of a mature male with <unk> <unk> and <unk> between these and the nose . The forehead is gathered in a <unk> . The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth . Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner , the exception being the ears . These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another . The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 9 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 66 . It measures 1 @.@ 65 metres ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 36 metres ( 4 @.@ 5 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 17 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the <unk> at San Lorenzo ; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards , half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream . Although it was documented by archaeologists , it remained for some time in its place of discovery before being moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . The headdress is of a single piece without a distinct <unk> . The sides display features that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailing to the bottom of the monument . The <unk> are rectangular plates with an additional <unk> element at the front . The head is also depicted wearing a nose @-@ ring . The face is smiling and has <unk> under the eyes and at the edge of the mouth . It has <unk> <unk> and wide eyes . The mouth is closed and the upper lip is badly damaged . The sculpture suffered some mutilation in antiquity , with nine pits <unk> into the face and headdress . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 10 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 89 ) has been moved to the <unk> <unk> de San Lorenzo <unk> near <unk> . It stands 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) tall and measures 1 @.@ 43 metres ( 4 @.@ 7 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 92 metres ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) deep ; it weighs 8 tons .

 Three of the La <unk> heads were found in a line running east @-@ west in the northern Complex I ; all three faced northwards , away from the city centre . The other head was found in Complex B to the south of the Great Pyramid , in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures . The latter , the first of the La <unk> heads to be discovered , was found during archaeological exploration of La <unk> in 1925 ; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew <unk> to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940 . They were located approximately 0 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 56 mi ) to the north of Monument 1 . 
 La <unk> Monument 1 is speculated to have been the portrait of La <unk> 's final ruler . Monument 1 measures 2 @.@ 41 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 2 @.@ 08 metres ( 6 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 95 metres ( 6 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 24 tons . The front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal . Above these symbols is an angular U @-@ shaped decoration descending from the <unk> . On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress , passing in front of the ear . Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the <unk> to the base of the monument . The features are those of a mature man , with <unk> around the mouth , eyes and nose . Monument 1 is the best preserved head at La <unk> but has suffered from erosion , particularly at the back . The head was first described by Franz <unk> and Oliver La <unk> who investigated the La <unk> remains on behalf of Tulane University in 1925 . When discovered it was half @-@ buried ; its massive size meant that the <unk> were unable to excavate it completely . Matthew <unk> fully excavated the monument in 1940 , after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years . Monument 1 has been moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> . The head was found in its original context ; associated finds have been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . 
 La <unk> Monument 2 measures 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 98 metres ( 3 @.@ 2 ft ) deep ; the head weighs 11 @.@ 8 tons . The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth . The <unk> are given prominence by the action of smiling ; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress . The face is badly eroded , <unk> the features . In addition to the severe erosion damage , the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately <unk> . The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid @-@ platform A @-@ 2 . <unk> dating of the monument 's context dates it to between 1000 and 600 BC . Monument 2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery . The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased . A strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head , descending as far as the <unk> . The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the <unk> , with an associated clip or <unk> . The surviving details of the headdress and <unk> are <unk> similar to those of <unk> <unk> Monument A. The head has been moved to the <unk> del <unk> de <unk> in <unk> . 
 La <unk> Monument 3 stands 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) deep ; it weighs 12 @.@ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> . Like the other La <unk> heads , its context has been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through <unk> , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . <unk> descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the <unk> ; they probably represent <unk> ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the <unk> region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the <unk> of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the <unk> expressions of the other <unk> colossal heads . 
 La <unk> Monument 4 measures 2 @.@ 26 metres ( 7 @.@ 4 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . It weighs 19 @.@ 8 tons . It was found a few metres to the west of Monument 2 and has been moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> . As with the other heads in the group , its archaeological context has been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . The headdress is elaborate and , although damaged , various details are still discernible . The base of the headdress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead . One side is decorated with a double @-@ disc motif that may have been repeated on the other ; if so , damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it . The top of the headdress is decorated with the <unk> foot of a bird of prey . Either <unk> or <unk> of hair descend on either side of the face , from the headdress to the base of the monument . Only one <unk> survives ; it is flat , in the form of a rounded square , and is decorated with a cross motif . The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged . The surviving features display a <unk> and <unk> around the nose and <unk> . The head displays prominent teeth .

 The two heads at <unk> <unk> , with the La <unk> head , are <unk> distinct from the other known examples . <unk> de la <unk> views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement . These heads are sculpted with relatively simple <unk> ; they have squat , wide proportions and distinctive facial features . The two <unk> <unk> heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the <unk> <unk> heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of <unk> culture , carried out by Matthew <unk> in 1938 . 
 <unk> <unk> Monument A ( also known as <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 1 ) was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the north of the modern village of <unk> <unk> . After its discovery it remained half @-@ buried until it was excavated by Matthew <unk> in 1939 . At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village , probably in the early 1960s . It has since been moved to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> . Monument A stands 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) tall ; it measures 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) deep , and is estimated to weigh 7 @.@ 8 tons . The head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned , and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the <unk> . The face is carved with deep <unk> between the <unk> and the nose and around the mouth ; the forehead is <unk> into a <unk> . The upper lip has suffered recent damage , with the left portion <unk> away . 
 <unk> <unk> Monument Q ( also known as the <unk> Head and <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 2 ) measures 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 34 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 8 @.@ 5 tons . Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from <unk> hill . Monument Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered . It was moved to the plaza of Santiago <unk> in 1951 and remains there to this day . Monument Q was first described by Williams and <unk> in an article published in 1965 . The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue @-@ shaped ornament , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven <unk> of hair bound with <unk> . A strap descends from each side of the headdress , passing over the ears and to the base of the monument . The face has pronounced <unk> around the nose , mouth and eyes .

 The La <unk> region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the <unk> <unk> . The La <unk> colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los <unk> , on the north side of El <unk> volcano near to Santiago <unk> . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ <unk> ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long <unk> knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La <unk> head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago . 
 The La <unk> head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) by 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons . It is <unk> distinct from the other examples , and <unk> de la <unk> placed it late in the <unk> time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band . 
 The original location of the La <unk> head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base . Rock was not removed from around the <unk> as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be <unk> out without finished detail . The right hand <unk> also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La <unk> head was almost certainly carved from a raw <unk> rather than being sculpted from a throne .

 <unk> <unk> Monument 23 dates to the Middle <unk> period , and is found in <unk> <unk> , an important city in the foothills of the <unk> Pacific coast , in the modern department of <unk> . It appears to be an <unk> @-@ style colossal head re @-@ carved into a niche figure sculpture . If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> . 
 Monument 23 is sculpted from <unk> and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 @.@ 84 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 56 metres ( 5 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . Like the examples from the <unk> <unk> , the monument features a flat back . Lee Parsons contests John Graham 's identification of Monument 23 as a re @-@ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the <unk> eyes of an open @-@ <unk> monster <unk> upwards . <unk> this , James Porter has claimed that the re @-@ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident . 
 Monument 23 was damaged in the mid @-@ twentieth century by a local <unk> who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel <unk> . As a result , the top is fragmented , although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place .

 On 12 January 2009 , at least three people , including two <unk> and one American , entered the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces , including the four La <unk> colossal heads . The <unk> were all members of an evangelical church and appeared to have been carrying out a supposed pre @-@ Columbian ritual , during which salts , grape juice and oil were thrown on the heads . It was estimated that 300 @,@ 000 pesos ( US $ 21 @,@ 900 ) would be needed to repair the damage , and the restoration process would last four months .

" It 's hard not to be [ in love with basketball ] when you 're a kid growing up in Indiana " , Stevens later said . 
 For his eighth birthday , Stevens received a new basketball <unk> . " It ’ s so much fun to dream in your <unk> , " he later remarked . " That ’ s where my friends and I hung out . It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era . " When a friend , Brandon <unk> , had a basketball court installed in his back yard , Stevens " appeared <unk> . " He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for <unk> cheese sandwiches over to <unk> 's house , so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook . 
 <unk> 's court soon became a gathering place , where <unk> kids and kids from the surrounding areas would hold <unk> games . These games helped develop Stevens ' competitive streak .

 After the end of the 2009 – 10 season , Brad Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention . President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to <unk> him on Butler 's season . David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance . Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67 % . Stevens received fan letters from around the world , and his phone rang off the hook . He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10 . " It 's all been very surreal , " Stevens said . " If you are the runner @-@ up , you don 't expect to talk to the president . " " It 's been a little overwhelming , because I 'm a pretty simple guy , " he added . 
 The 2009 – 10 season also helped increase Butler 's recruiting profile . Asked if the increased fame would change things , Stevens said it better not <unk> him or the university . " I look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity . "

 On April 8 , 2010 , Stevens signed a long @-@ term deal with Butler , extending his contract through the <unk> – 22 season . Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed ; however , Butler president Bobby <unk> had publicly stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens ' base salary to approximately US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a few days prior . Stevens had previously made US $ 395 @,@ 000 plus benefits in base salary , a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach .

 = = Coaching style = = 
 
 According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations , while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge . " I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach , " he told himself . Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional , instead quietly observing on the <unk> with folded arms . He does not get upset about bad calls by <unk> or player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willie <unk> explained Butler 's 2010 Final Four run by saying , " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words . Then he said he believes in us , he loves us and we 're going to win the game . " On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , just at a little louder <unk> " , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of being <unk> for making a bad play . 
 <unk> , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far from it . " I 'm not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . " Former player Joel <unk> says " Everyone sees Brad as a level @-@ headed , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We would get into it constantly , whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers . " 
 Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tries to add a few new <unk> specific to that game 's opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronald <unk> agrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time . 
 Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler was <unk> in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go . But what does that really mean ? It 's not just get better <unk> , it is , if we give up 3 less <unk> a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country " . The team got the message , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team of <unk> to analyze the teams play . 
 Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball <unk> and good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into <unk> mistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else , " Stevens says . " <unk> the next game . <unk> the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's boring . It 's also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . " I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn 't easy to define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . " 
 Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after " top recruits . " " The guys we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren 't very highly ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very good high school careers or careers at other places ( transfers ) , but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players . But they all had <unk> . " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally . 
 Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching <unk> , but is not interested in self @-@ promotion . He instead prefers to <unk> the praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his <unk> . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " . 
 The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and other commentators have attributed Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not <unk> easily " , and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , " <unk> says . " <unk> , he has great <unk> and communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the <unk> . " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much enjoy [ Butler 's ] style of play . "

 Brad Stevens is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " baby @-@ faced " . One commentator remarked , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start <unk> . " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a player . He is also known for projecting a professional , " corporate " look from the sidelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching , he replies " If everything else remained the same , I would have been as happy as <unk> ... Friends and family and faith , they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy ( née <unk> ) , while attending <unk> University . Tracy , who played soccer for <unk> , quickly learned of Brad 's love for basketball ; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and from <unk> in 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western 's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad . She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis , and the couple married in August 2003 . Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer . Tracy also serves as Brad 's agent . 
 Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society 's Coaches <unk> . Cancer . Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy 's mother died of the disease in June 2004 . The day before Butler 's 2010 Final Four appearance , they hosted a fundraiser for the organization . Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the <unk> Foundation for Kids , a charity <unk> <unk> children run by former Butler player Avery <unk> . Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a one @-@ game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler 's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later . At the request of Andrew 's widow , Sam , Brad delivered the <unk> at the memorial service on January 17 , 2016 .

 = <unk> ( crater ) = 
 
 <unk> is an impact crater that lies at the south pole of the Moon . The peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior is <unk> in shadow ( a <unk> of eternal darkness ) . The low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze <unk> shed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measurements by the <unk> <unk> spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater , which may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest <unk> . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 The rotational axis of the Moon lies within <unk> , only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 4 @.@ 2 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough , <unk> terrain . It is located within the South Pole @-@ <unk> basin on a <unk> . The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is sloped about 1 @.@ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age of the crater is about 3 @.@ 6 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years . 
 Because the orbit of the Moon is <unk> only 5 ° from the ecliptic , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness . Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth @-@ based radar studies . <unk> along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun . <unk> illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s . 
 The shadowed portion of the crater was <unk> with the <unk> Camera of the Japanese <unk> spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6 @.@ 6 km diameter floor . The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is covered by an uneven mound @-@ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 200 m in height . 
 The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 K. For <unk> , the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that arrives here following a <unk> impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface . However , the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice . 
 This crater was named after Ernest Henry <unk> , an Anglo @-@ Irish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker , <unk> , de <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger craters <unk> and Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent . 
 
 = = Exploration = = 
 
 From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficult . Detailed mapping of the polar regions and <unk> of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft . <unk> lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole @-@ <unk> basin , which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior . 
 A neutron <unk> on board the <unk> <unk> spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater <unk> . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor . 
 From Earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , <unk> appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of <unk> since its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice . ( See Shoemaker ( lunar crater ) , for example . ) 
 Radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission demonstrate that the inner walls of <unk> are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some <unk> craters . In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its <unk> blanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface <unk> , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission . This interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits . 
 Optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar <unk> spacecraft <unk> in 2007 . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel . 
 On November 15 , 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . The moon impact probe ( <unk> ) was launched from the Indian <unk> @-@ I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar <unk> , video imaging system , and a mass <unk> , which will be used to search for water . 
 
 = = Potential uses = = 
 
 Some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant illumination . At these <unk> sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night . 
 While scientific experiments performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this " ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth . 
 This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall <unk> Mountain , a peak that is <unk> visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped . 
 NASA has named the rim of <unk> as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by <unk> and continuously staffed by a crew by <unk> . The location would promote self @-@ <unk> for lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . Furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture .

 American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam <unk> and written by Alan Ball .

 Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992 . He <unk> the play after realizing the story would not work on stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball 's frustrating <unk> writing for several sitcoms . <unk> Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the then @-@ fledgling film studio bought Ball 's script for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> several other production bodies .

American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director <unk> ' film debut ; <unk> after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and <unk> , <unk> was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " A @-@ list " directors turned down the opportunity . 
 Spacey was <unk> ' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better @-@ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until <unk> offered the part to <unk> without DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles . <unk> ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and <unk> to generate tension . <unk> Conrad Hall complemented <unk> ' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events . During editing , <unk> made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script . 
 Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @-@ reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide . Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis on <unk> , Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting . DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film 's chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , the film won Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( for Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay , and Best <unk> . It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors , mainly for the direction , writing , and acting .

 Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the quality of the film , as their interpretations of it . Described by many as about " the meaning of life " or " the hollow existence of the American suburbs " , the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers . <unk> is <unk> , saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : " a mystery story , a <unk> journey through American <unk> , a series of love stories ; [ ... ] it was about imprisonment , [ ... ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . It was funny ; it was angry , sad . " The literary critic and author Wayne C. <unk> concludes that the film <unk> any one interpretation : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be adequately summarized as ' here is a satire on what 's wrong with American life ' ; that plays down the celebration of beauty . It is more tempting to <unk> it as ' a portrait of the beauty underlying American <unk> and <unk> ' , but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror , and Ball 's disgust with our <unk> . It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live . " He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who " [ <unk> ] all of the choices " . He contends that in American Beauty 's case , it is neither <unk> nor Ball . <unk> considers the voice to be Ball 's , but even while the writer was " strongly influential " on set , he often had to accept deviations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic . With " <unk> voices <unk> on the original author 's , " <unk> says , those who interpret American Beauty " have forgotten to probe for the elusive center " . According to <unk> , the film 's true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds of people put into its production , agreeing and <unk> , inserting and cutting " .

 <unk> called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment . The <unk> of Lester 's existence is established through his gray , <unk> workplace and <unk> clothing . In these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " reiterating rituals that hardly please him " . He <unk> in the <unk> of his shower ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames , such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . The academic and author <unk> W. <unk> argues that Lester 's journey is the story 's center . His sexual <unk> through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to <unk> " . After Lester shares a joint with Ricky , his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn . Changed by Ricky 's " attractive , profound confidence " , Lester is convinced that Angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his " <unk> , <unk> <unk> suburban existence " ; he takes a job at a fast @-@ food outlet , which allows him to <unk> to a point when he could " see his whole life ahead of him " . 
 When Lester is caught <unk> by Carolyn , his angry <unk> about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . By <unk> the issue and Carolyn 's " superficial investments in others " , Lester is trying to " regain a voice in a home that [ only respects ] the voices of mother and daughter " . His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she confesses her <unk> , he no longer thinks of her as a sex object , but as a daughter . He holds her close and " <unk> her up " . <unk> called it " the most satisfying end to [ Lester 's ] journey there could possibly have been " . With these final scenes , <unk> intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a " mythical quest " . After Lester gets a beer from the <unk> , the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing a <unk> down which he walks " to meet his fate " . Having begun to act his age again , Lester achieves closure . As he <unk> at a family photo , the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall , onto which blood <unk> as a gunshot rings out ; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester 's death . His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky . <unk> said that Ricky 's staring into Lester 's dead eyes is " the culmination of the theme " of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .

 Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , Bringing Out the Dead , and Magnolia , American Beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ] more meaningful lives " . The film argues the case against conformity , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the <unk> ' other neighbors , are a satire of " gay <unk> <unk> " , who " [ invest ] in the <unk> <unk> " that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples . The feminist academic and author <unk> R. <unk> argues that American Beauty uses its " art house " <unk> to direct its message of <unk> primarily to the middle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché of <unk> preoccupation ; [ ... ] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual ' self ' through denial and <unk> is always open to those wealthy enough to choose , and <unk> enough to present themselves <unk> as a rebel . " 
 Professor Roy M. <unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the <unk> ' neighborhood with Lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . It also sets a series of mysteries ; <unk> asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ? If he 's already dead , why <unk> with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive ? There is also the question of how Lester has died — or will die . " <unk> believes the preceding scene — Jane 's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery . Professor Ann C. Hall <unk> ; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside " to view the film and its philosophical issues " . Through this examination of Lester 's life , <unk> and death , American Beauty <unk> American middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Lester 's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devotee of the popular media 's <unk> of <unk> male sexuality as a sensible route to personal <unk> " . Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness ; from her belief in " house beautiful " domestic <unk> to her car and <unk> outfit , Carolyn 's domain is a " <unk> American <unk> vision of <unk> , or Eden " . The <unk> are unaware that they are " <unk> philosophically , and devout consumers <unk> " who expect the " <unk> of American beauty " to give them happiness . <unk> argues that " they are helpless in the face of the <unk> economic and sexual stereotypes [ ... ] that they and their culture have designated for their salvation . " 
 The film presents Ricky as its " visionary , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in the <unk> of everyday life , <unk> as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , <unk> in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was " an entire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in . " <unk> argues that Ricky , in looking past the " cultural <unk> " , has " [ grasped ] the <unk> <unk> of the created world " to see God . As the film progresses , the <unk> move closer to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester only <unk> personal satisfaction at the film 's end . On the <unk> of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she admits her <unk> . Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile but <unk> creatures they are " . He looks at a picture of his family in <unk> times , and dies having had an <unk> that <unk> him with " wonder , joy , and soul @-@ shaking gratitude " — he has finally seen the world as it is . 
 According to Patti <unk> , colors are used symbolically throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ defines ] Lester 's arc " . First seen in drab colors that reflect his <unk> , Lester surrounds himself with red as he <unk> his individuality . The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol ; when Lester <unk> about Angela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose <unk> . In these scenes , the rose <unk> Lester 's desire for her . When associated with Carolyn , the rose represents a " façade for suburban success " . Roses are included in almost every shot inside the <unk> ' home , where they signify " a mask covering a bleak , <unk> reality " . Carolyn feels that " as long as there can be <unk> , all is well " . She cuts the <unk> and puts them in <unk> , where they adorn her " <unk> vision of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . The <unk> in the vase in the Angela – Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester 's previous life and Carolyn ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the <unk> — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot . Lester 's <unk> at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels . The constant use of red " <unk> [ the audience ] <unk> " into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood <unk> on the wall . 
 
 = = = <unk> and repression = = = 
 
 <unk> argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality . Lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually frustrated , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold <unk> " to a more <unk> soul who " [ sings ] happily along with " the music in her car . Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , through Angela 's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other . Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . By the end of the film , Angela 's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester 's attraction to her . Col. <unk> reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , " How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face ? How can they be so <unk> ? " To which Ricky replies , " That 's the thing , Dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to be <unk> of . " <unk> argues that Col. <unk> ' reaction is not <unk> , but an " <unk> self @-@ <unk> " . 
 With other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as Fight Club , In the Company of Men ( 1997 ) , American <unk> ( 2000 ) , and Boys Don 't <unk> ( 1999 ) , American Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue of <unk> in crisis " . Professor Vincent <unk> charges that in their reinforcement of <unk> " against threats posed by war , by <unk> , and by feminist and <unk> challenges " , these films present a need to " focus on , and even to privilege " aspects of <unk> " deemed ' <unk> ' " . Lester 's transformation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the brunt of [ lack of being ] " and he will not stand for being <unk> . Lester 's attempts to " strengthen traditional <unk> " conflict with his responsibilities as a father . Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively , he does not become " the <unk> figure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club " . <unk> concludes that Lester 's behavior toward Angela is " a <unk> but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " . 
 <unk> says the film " explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against <unk> " ; a recurring theme of Ball 's work is his comparison of the <unk> against <unk> and homosexuality . Instead of making an overt distinction , American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence . Col. <unk> is so <unk> of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester . Ball said , " The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [ they ] can do . " The film implies two <unk> <unk> desires : Lester 's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter , while Col. <unk> ' repression is exhibited through the almost <unk> discipline with which he controls Ricky . Consequently , Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while Angela 's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy . Col. <unk> represents Ball 's father , whose <unk> homosexual desires led to his own <unk> . Ball rewrote Col. <unk> to delay revealing him as homosexual , which <unk> reads as a possible " <unk> of Ball 's own patriarchal @-@ <unk> fantasies " . 
 
 = = = <unk> and music = = = 
 
 American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , only <unk> with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death . Jacqueline <unk> says that the plot " occupies [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing Lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches on forever like an ocean of time " . <unk> argues that a " rhythm of repetition " forms the core of the film 's structure . For example , two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness . Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a similarly " <unk> and <unk> " scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment . 
 Lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and repetitive @-@ motion shots ; <unk> uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> in several sequences , and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy . One example is the <unk> scene — Lester 's first encounter with Angela . While the <unk> perform their half @-@ time routine to " On Broadway " , Lester becomes increasingly <unk> on Angela . Time slows to represent his " <unk> hypnosis " and Lester begins to <unk> that Angela 's performance is for him alone . " On Broadway " — which provides a conventional <unk> to the <unk> action — is replaced by discordant , <unk> music that lacks melody or progression . This <unk> score is important to creating the narrative <unk> in the sequence ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length . The effect is one that Stan Link <unk> to " vertical time " , described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that <unk> " a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a potentially infinite ' now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . The music is used like a visual cue , so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela . The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of " On Broadway " and <unk> time . 
 According to Drew Miller of <unk> , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' <unk> and <unk> the subtext . The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester 's attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s <unk> American repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music . <unk> ' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a <unk> element at work , " making good on [ the film 's ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " , which plays during Angela 's seduction of Lester . At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the seduction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester 's view of Angela — " the <unk> , fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the ' American Beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small @-@ <unk> girl who , like his wife , has <unk> developed a false public self " .

 In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and <unk> . He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew <unk> , suggested he write a <unk> script to " <unk> [ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . Ball pitched three ideas to <unk> : two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story 's lack of an easily <unk> concept , <unk> selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom , Oh , <unk> Up . He channeled his anger and frustration at having to <unk> to network demands on that show — and during his <unk> on Grace Under Fire and <unk> — into writing American Beauty . 
 Ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies . <unk> passed the script to several producers , including Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glenn <unk> and Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he received <unk> from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it outright for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> Fox <unk> Pictures , October Films , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , and <unk> Entertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . 
 <unk> and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film 's development , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered " A @-@ list " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well @-@ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert <unk> ; neither accepted . In the same year , <unk> ( then a theater director ) revived the musical <unk> in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall . Beth <unk> of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for <unk> with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility . <unk> came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at <unk> 's house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood . <unk> later met with Spielberg ; impressed by <unk> ' productions of Oliver ! and <unk> , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty . 
 <unk> found that he still had to convince DreamWorks ' production executives to let him direct . He had already discussed the film with <unk> and Cohen , and felt they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen <unk> , he was impressed with <unk> ' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt that <unk> liked to look under the story 's surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty . <unk> ' background also <unk> him , because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Walter <unk> , and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone — <unk> pitched himself to the studio . The studio soon approached <unk> with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules — $ 150 @,@ 000 . <unk> accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , he only earned $ 38 @,@ 000 . In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted <unk> to direct the film .

 Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . <unk> a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk> . He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character 's story was .. " intensely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles . 
 Ball based Lester 's story on aspects of his own life . Lester 's re @-@ examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @-@ 30s ; like Lester , Ball put aside his <unk> to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. <unk> , a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . Ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life . He said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone . 
 In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of shooting , Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script , feeling they were being <unk> ; the final <unk> to alter the scene came from DreamWorks ' then @-@ president Walter <unk> . He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology , the hero " has a moment of <unk> before [ ... ] tragedy occurs " . Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption . <unk> and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away , as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired . Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. <unk> ' service in the Marines , a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual <unk> . In love with another Marine , Col. <unk> sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the " sin " of being gay . Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — Col. <unk> was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. <unk> ' later pass at Lester . Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. <unk> , though all that remained in later drafts was subtext . 
 Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty . Ball was on @-@ set for <unk> and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His original <unk> scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are <unk> for Lester 's murder after being framed by Col. <unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cynicism " at the time of writing ( see " Editing " ) . Ball and <unk> revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @-@ through . 
 The shooting script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see something like that , it 's like God is looking right at you , just for a second . And if you 're careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : " Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that scene . They said it 's not important . I said , ' You 're out of your fucking mind . It 's one of the most important scenes in the movie ! ' [ ... ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . " Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a <unk> , it presents a " turning point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 drafts .

 <unk> had Spacey and <unk> in mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWorks executives were <unk> . The studio suggested several <unk> , including Bruce Willis , Kevin <unk> , or John <unk> to play Lester , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn . <unk> did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The <unk> <unk> and Seven , and 1992 's <unk> Glen Ross . Spacey was surprised ; he said , " I usually play characters who are very quick , very <unk> and smart . [ ... ] I usually <unk> in dark , sort of <unk> waters . This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his instincts . This is actually much closer to me , to what I am , than those other parts . " <unk> offered <unk> the role of Carolyn without the studio 's consent ; although executives were upset at <unk> , by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and <unk> . 
 Spacey loosely based Lester 's early " <unk> " <unk> on Walter <unk> . During the film , Lester 's physique improves from <unk> to toned ; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but because <unk> shot the scenes out of chronological order , Spacey varied <unk> to portray the stages . Before filming , <unk> and Spacey analyzed Jack <unk> 's performance in The <unk> ( 1960 ) , because <unk> wanted Spacey to emulate " the way [ <unk> ] moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man " . Spacey 's <unk> is a <unk> to Sunset Boulevard ( 1950 ) , which is also narrated in <unk> by a dead character . <unk> felt it evoked Lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness . <unk> recalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " I used to <unk> constantly . You 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . " <unk> and a hair stylist collaborated to create a " <unk> president <unk> " hairstyle , and <unk> and production designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish Carolyn 's environment of a " spotless suburban manor " . To help <unk> get into Carolyn 's mindset , <unk> gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like . He lent <unk> the Bobby <unk> version of the song " Don 't Rain on My Parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car . 
 For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , DreamWorks gave <unk> <unk> <unk> . By November 1998 , <unk> Birch , Wes Bentley , and Mena <unk> had been cast in the parts — in Birch 's case , despite the fact she was <unk> for her nude scene . As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United States , her parents had to approve her brief <unk> scene in the movie . Child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene . Bentley <unk> competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast . The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part . To prepare , <unk> provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter Gallagher and Alison <unk> were cast ( as <unk> Kane and Barbara <unk> ) after filming began in December 1998 . <unk> gave <unk> a book of paintings by <unk> <unk> . He told her , " Your character is in there somewhere . " <unk> cut much of Barbara 's dialogue , including conversations between Colonel <unk> and her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence . Chris Cooper plays Colonel <unk> , Scott Bakula plays Jim <unk> , and Sam <unk> plays Jim Berkley . Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple in the film . Ball 's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a " bland , boring , heterosexual couple " who wore matching clothes : " I can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same <unk> . 
 <unk> insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one . Several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An early scene showing the <unk> leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost <unk> Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " .

 Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , California , and at Hancock Park and <unk> in Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in <unk> , California , and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in <unk> , California ; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students . The film is set in an upper middle @-@ class neighborhood in an unidentified American town . Production designer <unk> <unk> likened the <unk> to <unk> , Illinois , but said , " it 's not about a place , it 's about an <unk> . [ ... ] The milieu was pretty much <unk> , USA — <unk> mobile <unk> . " The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters , who are also <unk> . <unk> said , " All of them are very strained , and their lives are <unk> . " The <unk> ' household was designed as the reverse of the <unk> ' — the former a pristine ideal , but <unk> and lacking in " inner balance " , leading to Carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a " perfect all @-@ American household " ; the <unk> ' home is depicted in " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " . 
 The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner <unk> 's " <unk> Street " for the <unk> and <unk> ' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. <unk> — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . <unk> made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the <unk> , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the <unk> ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the <unk> ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his " <unk> " personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side . The production deliberately <unk> the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The <unk> ' home uses cool blues , while the <unk> ' is kept in a " depressed military palette " . 
 <unk> ' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed , with a <unk> design that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright , <unk> , hard edged , near <unk> @-@ like take on American <unk> " ; <unk> constantly directed his set <unk> to empty the frame . He made Lester 's fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , and <unk> made minimal use of <unk> , feeling that stable shots generated more tension . For example , when <unk> used a slow push in to the <unk> ' dinner table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters . He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the table . <unk> did use a hand @-@ held camera for the scene in which Col. <unk> beats Ricky . <unk> said the camera provided the scene with a " <unk> [ ... ] off @-@ balance energy " . He also went hand @-@ held for the <unk> of Ricky 's <unk> footage . <unk> took a long time to get the quality of Ricky 's footage to the level he wanted . For the plastic @-@ bag footage , <unk> used wind machines to move the bag in the air . The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy <unk> , so he shot the scene himself . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground . <unk> was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag . 
 <unk> avoided using close @-@ ups , as he believed the technique was <unk> ; he also cited Spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience <unk> at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) screen . Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised <unk> not to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end of a long working day . <unk> said , " That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite Spielberg 's support , DreamWorks and <unk> fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio <unk> little with the film 's content . Spacey , <unk> and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum . <unk> was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to <unk> the scenes . He said , " I started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : [ ... ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a novice , <unk> drew on the experience of Hall : " I made a very conscious decision early on , if I didn 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don 't understand what you 're talking about , please explain it . ' " 
 <unk> encouraged some improvisation ; for example , when Lester <unk> in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improvise several <unk> for the act in each take . <unk> said , " I wanted that not just because it was funny [ ... ] but because I didn 't want it to seem <unk> . I wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break through . " Spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , but <unk> could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery . Most of the rose <unk> in Lester 's fantasies were added in post @-@ production , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . When Lester <unk> about Angela in a rose @-@ <unk> bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally .

 American Beauty was edited by Christopher <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; <unk> began in the position , but had to leave halfway through post @-@ production because of a scheduling conflict with Me , Myself and Irene ( 2000 ) ( in which Chris Cooper also starred ) . <unk> and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments . <unk> realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned . He believed he had been making a " much more whimsical , [ ... ] <unk> " film than what came together in the edit suite . Instead , <unk> was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to <unk> to craft the film along these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town . <unk> spent two days filming Spacey against <unk> , but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — " like a <unk> brothers movie " — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set . The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father . This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester 's death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane 's request was not serious . However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — <unk> used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the <unk> effects in the dream sequence . 
 <unk> spent more time <unk> the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . He <unk> several versions of the opening ; the first edit included <unk> scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester 's murder , but <unk> <unk> these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production . <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode of <unk> Blue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really register " . <unk> and he argued , but Ball was more accepting after <unk> cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .

 Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ; <unk> believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with . Instead , <unk> asked Fred <unk> , who turned the job down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended to <unk> by Tom Cruise , because of Hall 's work on Without <unk> ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had executive produced . <unk> was directing Cruise 's then @-@ wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during <unk> on American Beauty , and had already <unk> the whole film . Hall was involved for one month during <unk> ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script , and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> . Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals . 
 Hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <unk> , to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action . Hall and <unk> first discussed the intended mood of a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary . In most cases , Hall first lit the scene 's subject by " painting in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he reflected from <unk> or white card on the ceiling . This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light <unk> and the dark areas free of spill . Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format , using <unk> Vision <unk> <unk> 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the <unk> @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within . He shot the whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( <unk> ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide , Hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects . He used <unk> Platinum cameras with the company 's <unk> series of prime and <unk> lenses . Hall employed <unk> Vision <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had difficulty adjusting to <unk> 's newly introduced Vision release print stock , which , combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast . Hall contacted <unk> , who sent him a batch of <unk> that was 5 % lower in contrast . Hall used a 1 / 8 inch <unk> Black <unk> filter for almost every scene , which he said in <unk> may not have been the best choice , as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its <unk> release print led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore , the <unk> from the filter was not required . When he saw the film in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , the <unk> from the Super 35 – <unk> conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended . 
 A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and <unk> . <unk> asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top of the truck . When <unk> returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it , in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's encounter with Angela at the <unk> ' home , Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights ; in another , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light ( although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene , Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced ) . For the close @-@ ups when Lester and Angela move to the <unk> , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .

 Thomas Newman 's score was recorded in Santa Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by <unk> . Newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a more <unk> score than he had previously created . He built each cue around " small , <unk> repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thinning of the texture for eight bars " . The percussion instruments included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , piano , <unk> , and <unk> ; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . Newman also used electronic music and on " <unk> " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a <unk> mandolin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the script : " It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [ that ] . " 
 The soundtrack features songs by Newman , Bobby <unk> , The Who , Free , <unk> , The <unk> Who , Bill <unk> , Betty Carter , Peggy Lee , The Folk <unk> , Gomez , and Bob Dylan , as well as two cover versions — The Beatles ' " Because " performed by Elliott Smith , and Neil Young 's " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " performed by Annie Lennox . Produced by the film 's music supervisor Chris <unk> , an abridged soundtrack album was released on October 5 , 1999 , and went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album . An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman 's score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album . <unk> considered the score to be one of Newman 's best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film 's <unk> aspirations " . In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " .

 DreamWorks contracted Amazon.com to create the official website , marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film . The website included an overview , a photo gallery , cast and crew <unk> , and exclusive interviews with Spacey and <unk> . The film 's tagline — " look closer " — originally came from a cutting <unk> on Lester 's workplace <unk> by the set <unk> . DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults , the other at teenagers . Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose . Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films , David <unk> of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beauty 's highly , saying it evoked the tagline ; he said , " You return to the poster again and again , thinking , this time you 're gonna find something . " DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film ; according to <unk> , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward . The studio <unk> agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose , California . <unk> claimed the screening went very well .

 American Beauty was released on VHS on May 9 , 2000 , and on DVD with the <unk> format on October 24 , 2000 . Before the North American rental release on May 9 , <unk> Video wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its " guaranteed title " range , whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy . <unk> and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit @-@ sharing deal , so <unk> ordered two @-@ thirds the number of copies it originally intended . DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental ; <unk> 's share would usually have been about 400 @,@ 000 of these . Some <unk> stores only displayed 60 copies , and others did not display the film at all , forcing customers to ask for it . The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation ; <unk> claimed it was only " [ monitoring ] customer demand " due to the reduced availability . <unk> 's strategy leaked before May 9 , leading to a 30 % order increase from other retailers . In its first week of rental release , American Beauty made $ 6 @.@ 8 million . This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and <unk> reached an agreement . In the same year , The Sixth <unk> made $ 22 million , while Fight Club made $ 8 @.@ 1 million , though the latter 's North American theatrical performance was just 29 % that of American Beauty . <unk> 's strategy also affected rental fees ; American Beauty averaged $ 3 @.@ 12 , compared with $ 3 @.@ 40 for films that <unk> fully promoted . Only 53 % of the film 's rentals were from large outlets in the first week , compared with the usual 65 % .

 American Beauty was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the American press . It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey , <unk> and Ball . Variety reported that " no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal <unk> . " It was the best @-@ received title at the Toronto International Film Festival ( <unk> ) , where it won the People 's Choice award after a ballot of the festival 's audiences . <unk> 's director , Piers <unk> , said , " American Beauty was the <unk> of the festival , the film most talked @-@ about . " 
 Writing in Variety , Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble " could not be better " ; he praised Spacey 's " handling of <unk> , subtle sarcasm , and blunt talk " and the way he <unk> Lester with " genuine feeling " . Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his " <unk> and most agile " to date , and Roger <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who " does <unk> and foolish things [ but who ] doesn 't <unk> himself " . Kevin Jackson of <unk> & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of " both <unk> and hero " . Writing in Film Quarterly , Gary <unk> praised the actors , but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. <unk> were stereotypes . <unk> accused <unk> and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — a <unk> boy who 's an <unk> wealthy artist able to " finance [ his ] own projects " . <unk> said Angela was the most <unk> teenager , in particular with her " <unk> familiar " attempts to " live up to an unworthy image of herself " . Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal , but said their detailed <unk> made them memorable . Kenneth <unk> of the Los Angeles Times said the actors <unk> " <unk> " with what were difficult roles ; he called Spacey 's performance " the energy that drives the film " , saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic . " Against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , " <unk> concluded . 
 Maslin felt that <unk> directed with " terrific visual <unk> " , saying his <unk> style balanced " the <unk> and bright " and that he evoked the " delicate , <unk> power @-@ playing vignettes " of his theater work . Jackson said <unk> ' theatrical roots rarely showed , and that the " most remarkable " aspect was that Spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film . He said that <unk> worked the script 's <unk> smoothly , to the ensemble 's strengths , and staged the tonal shifts <unk> . McCarthy believed American Beauty a " stunning card of introduction " for film <unk> <unk> and Ball . He said <unk> ' " sure hand " was " as precise and controlled " as his theater work . McCarthy cited Hall 's involvement as fortunate for <unk> , as the cinematographer was " <unk> " at conveying the themes of a work . <unk> agreed that <unk> ' choice of collaborators was " <unk> " , naming Hall and Newman in particular . <unk> suggested that American Beauty may have benefited from <unk> ' inexperience , as his " anything 's possible daring " made him attempt beats that more <unk> directors might have avoided . <unk> felt that <unk> ' accomplishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ] <unk> " of Ball 's script — the simultaneously " <unk> [ ... ] and <unk> real " characters . <unk> , while critical of many of <unk> and Ball 's choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " . 
 <unk> cited Ball 's lack of <unk> when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness , in particular the script 's subtle changes in tone . McCarthy said the script was " as fresh and distinctive " as any of its American film contemporaries , and praised how it analyzed the characters while not <unk> narrative pace . He called Ball 's dialogue " tart " and said the characters — Carolyn <unk> — were " deeply drawn " . One other flaw , McCarthy said , was the revelation of Col. <unk> ' homosexuality , which he said evoked " <unk> <unk> " . Jackson said the film <unk> its clichéd setup to become a " wonderfully resourceful and <unk> comedy " . He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs , it did so with " unexpected nuance " . <unk> criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester 's murder , believing it <unk> and simply a way of generating suspense . McCarthy cited the production and costume design as <unk> , and said the soundtrack was good at creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story . <unk> concluded that American Beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film 's examination of " the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other 's lives " was its best point , and that although Lester and Angela 's dynamic was familiar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most enduring literary treatments " of the theme , such as <unk> . Nevertheless , <unk> believed that the film 's themes of <unk> and conformity in American <unk> were " <unk> " . McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar , but said it merely provided the film with a " starting point " from which to tell its " subtle and <unk> judged tale " . Maslin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim at targets that are none too fresh " , and that the theme of <unk> did not surprise , the film had its own " corrosive novelty " . <unk> awarded American Beauty four stars out of four , and <unk> said it was layered , <unk> , complex , and surprising , concluding it was " a hell of a picture " . 
 A few months after the film 's release , reports of a backlash appeared in the American press , and the years since have seen its critical regard <unk> . In 2005 , <unk> named American Beauty as one of 20 " most <unk> movies of all time " ; <unk> accepted the <unk> of the critical <unk> , saying , " I thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little <unk> at the time . " 
 Currently , the film holds an 88 % score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 180 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 ; the critical consensus reads , " <unk> cast and <unk> with dark , acid wit , American Beauty is a smart , provocative high point of late ' 90s mainstream Hollywood film . " Metacritic gives the film a score of 86 , based on 33 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim . "

 American Beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season . Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @-@ of @-@ year lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . By the end of the year , reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture ; however , at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000 , American Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay . 
 As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached , a <unk> had not emerged . DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @,@ 600 Academy Award voters . Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable settings " in voters ' communities . The studio 's candidate for Best Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shakespeare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . Nancy <unk> encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty , to set up displays of the film in the communities ' <unk> , and to arrange a question @-@ and @-@ answer session with <unk> for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Dale <unk> advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers . <unk> arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1 @,@ 000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many participating actors were also voters . Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance . 
 In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards ; its closest rivals , The Cider House Rules and The <unk> , received seven nominations each . In March 2000 , the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty 's closest rival for Best Picture was still The Cider House Rules , from <unk> . Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns ; DreamWorks bought 38 % more advertising space in Variety than <unk> . On March 26 , 2000 , American Beauty won five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay and Best <unk> . At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards , American Beauty won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated : Best Film , Best Actor , Best Actress ( <unk> ) , Best <unk> , Best Film Music and Best Editing . In 2000 , the <unk> Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign . In September 2008 , Empire named American Beauty the <unk> " Greatest Movie of All Time " after a poll of 10 @,@ 000 readers , 150 filmmakers , and 50 film critics , the fourth @-@ highest ranked movie from 1999 ( behind Fight Club , The Matrix , and Magnolia ) . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of 101 greatest screenplays .

 Christopher <unk> ( September 21 , 1758 – March 1 , 1827 ) was a prominent Massachusetts lawyer , <unk> politician , and U.S. diplomat . Born into a family divided by the American Revolution , <unk> sided with the victorious <unk> , established a successful law practice in Boston , and built a fortune by purchasing Revolutionary government debts at a discount and receiving full value for them from the government . 
 <unk> entered politics in 1788 , serving briefly in the Massachusetts legislature before being appointed U.S. District Attorney for Massachusetts . He was then appointed by President George Washington to a diplomatic commission dealing with maritime claims in Great Britain . He returned to Massachusetts in 1804 and <unk> state politics , running unsuccessfully for governor several times before winning in 1809 . He served one term , losing to Democratic @-@ Republican Elbridge Gerry in 1810 . He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Caleb Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 . 
 <unk> invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a major <unk> in the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and the <unk> Manufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts . <unk> was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in <unk> , Massachusetts , now known as <unk> Place , is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark .

 Christopher <unk> was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John <unk> , a successful merchant and <unk> . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , and <unk> temporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvard <unk> participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John <unk> . 
 <unk> graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Thomas <unk> , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The <unk> family was divided by the war : <unk> 's father was a <unk> who left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 . <unk> was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779 <unk> successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets . 
 
 = = Early legal career = = 
 
 After his military service <unk> studied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage . <unk> 's law practice flourished , in part because many <unk> lawyers had fled Massachusetts . <unk> 's clients included <unk> seeking to recover some of their assets , as well as London @-@ based British merchants with claims to pursue . His <unk> were generally well @-@ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer . 
 <unk> grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . The <unk> he purchased were paper that had been given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch of <unk> he purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3 @,@ 700 but had a face value of $ 25 @,@ 000 . In 1785 he married Rebecca <unk> Payne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime <unk> , and director of the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their social <unk> and became prominent members of Boston society . 
 In 1786 <unk> became concerned about a rise in anti @-@ lawyer sentiment in Massachusetts . <unk> over harsh policies pursued by Governor James <unk> <unk> into <unk> ' Rebellion , which required militia action to crush in 1787 . <unk> was one of several high @-@ profile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion ( included in this group were Theodore <unk> , Caleb Strong , James Sullivan , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , and Thomas <unk> ) . Although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . In 1788 , <unk> was elected a delegate to the 1789 Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution . His election was contested because Boston , where he lived , was at the time more inclined toward state power . <unk> nonetheless was strongly <unk> , urging support of the new Constitution .

 In 1788 <unk> was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . By his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . He also proposed that the state House and Senate agree by separate votes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789 <unk> decided to stand for reelection , but lost , owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held after <unk> opened several seats . 
 <unk> 's financial speculations in the late <unk> significantly multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew <unk> , a Boston businessman who had retained <unk> for legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental <unk> with a face value of $ 100 @,@ 000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October of that year , the pair had met this goal : <unk> had purchased $ 90 @,@ 000 worth of paper for about $ 20 @,@ 000 , and encouraged <unk> to purchase more than the $ 11 @,@ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it . <unk> also purchased Massachusetts war @-@ related debts , and lobbied Massachusetts <unk> for the U.S. government to assume those as well . 
 <unk> 's <unk> was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by <unk> 's friend Rufus King , passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value . Not only did <unk> win on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : John <unk> Adams wrote that <unk> 's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country . 
 The success of <unk> 's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with <unk> , William <unk> and Daniel Parker in an attempt to acquire U.S. foreign debt obligations on favorable terms . Parker was a business partner of <unk> 's , and <unk> was an influential New York businessman and Treasury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed <unk> . The partnership promoted sales of U.S. lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U.S. obligations to France . Although <unk> sank $ 10 @,@ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch <unk> <unk> the Americans . <unk> also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures . 
 Much of <unk> 's financial activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts , where his father @-@ in @-@ law was a director . <unk> himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bank <unk> its regulations on loan <unk> , a move that improved the stability of its capital . <unk> used the bank for most of his personal deposits , but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively high <unk> until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States . 
 The Bank of the United States was established by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale , and sought to open a branch in Boston . Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , and <unk> decided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank . He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank , a relatively large investment . <unk> was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch , and sought to merge state @-@ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . <unk> resigned from the board in 1794 , citing the demands of his law practice . 
 <unk> 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable <unk> Square , and also bought a country estate in <unk> that grew over time to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) . He had a house built on the estate , most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other similarly @-@ situated <unk> formed the Massachusetts Society for <unk> Agriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture .

 In 1789 President George Washington appointed <unk> the first United States Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for his support . <unk> controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators . 
 <unk> served as district attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U.S. neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several times to <unk> the French consul in Boston , Antoine <unk> , for <unk> and operating <unk> out of the Port of Boston , but he was <unk> by local <unk> that <unk> with the French . <unk> was eventually expelled on orders from President George Washington based on evidence provided by <unk> . 
 <unk> also promoted anti @-@ French sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym " <unk> " , he denounced the formation of " Democratic Societies " formed to oppose <unk> policy and support pro @-@ French positions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with the British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and negotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratification <unk> vocally supported . Although <unk> was hostile to French policy , he was on friendly terms with individual Frenchmen : he hosted the future French statesman <unk> when he visited the U.S. 
 In 1796 Washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms the Jay Treaty . As a result the <unk> moved to England that year , establishing a residence in the fashionable Hyde Park area . The commission was established to <unk> claims emanating from British <unk> of American vessels and cargoes , and from British claims relating to violations of American neutrality in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans ( <unk> , William Pinkney , and John <unk> ) and two British commissioners ( John <unk> and Nicholas <unk> ) ; <unk> was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @-@ minded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 
 Although <unk> was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what <unk> called a " <unk> of process " , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway . <unk> used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his <unk> estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in <unk> . After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for their <unk> property . 
 The commission resumed its work in early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110 @,@ 000 to British claimants and over $ 6 million to American claimants . The lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America 's good <unk> . 
 The <unk> 's social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatriates . When King left his post in May 1803 he named <unk> to head the London embassy as <unk> d <unk> . Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the British government accepted his role for the two @-@ month interval between King 's departure and the arrival of James Monroe as King 's replacement . The <unk> sailed for Boston in the spring of 1804 . 
 Rebecca <unk> used their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for their <unk> estate during their English <unk> . Designed with the assistance of French architect Joseph @-@ Guillaume <unk> and probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John <unk> , the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804 ( now known as <unk> Place ) is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture .

 Soon after his return to the United States , <unk> <unk> state politics , winning election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was active in the state <unk> Party organization , sitting on its secret central committee . He resumed his law practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas <unk> , accused of murdering Charles Austin . <unk> , an older <unk> attorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin 's Republican father . In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston , <unk> , fearing for his own safety , had armed himself with a <unk> pistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to beat <unk> with a cane , and <unk> fatally shot him in the encounter . <unk> was <unk> by Attorney General ( and future <unk> gubernatorial opponent ) James Sullivan , and the defense also included arch @-@ <unk> Harrison Gray <unk> . <unk> argued <unk> acted in self @-@ defense ; <unk> was acquitted of murder by a jury whose <unk> was <unk> and <unk> Paul <unk> after fifteen minutes ' <unk> . 
 <unk> also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure , spurring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance ( where is father @-@ in @-@ law had made his fortune ) , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a major <unk> in the Middlesex Canal , the <unk> Bridge ( the first to connect Boston to Cambridge ) , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the single @-@ site production of textiles was in <unk> near his estate . Not all of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a financial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to develop <unk> Point , the Cambridge side of the <unk> Bridge . The textile mill , however , was a success , and <unk> invested in the <unk> Manufacturing Company . When it decided to locate in what is now Lowell , Massachusetts , <unk> purchased shares in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which operated ( and still owns today ) the Lowell canals . 
 In 1806 <unk> won election to the State Senate . That year the Republicans were in the majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a <unk> . The legislature <unk> the ballots in a partisan manner ( for example , retaining ballots containing <unk> versions of Republican James Sullivan 's name and discarding similar ballots marked for <unk> Caleb Strong ) . <unk> and other <unk> raised a public <unk> , and the legislature relented , eventually <unk> Strong as the winner . 
 <unk> ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide of <unk> in the state , losing both times to moderate Republican James Sullivan . The <unk> gained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against Republican economic policies , but <unk> was criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against the <unk> Act of 1807 , which had a major negative effect on the state 's large merchant fleet . <unk> was in 1808 elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , where he successfully led <unk> efforts to ensure the selection of a <unk> slate of presidential electors . He also spearheaded actions to drive Senator John <unk> Adams from the <unk> Party over his support of Thomas Jefferson 's foreign policy . The legislature elected Adams ' successor nine months early , and gave Adams sufficiently <unk> instructions that he resigned the post and joined with the Republicans .

 <unk> led the <unk> to victory in 1809 against Sullivan 's successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , who had taken over as acting governor upon Sullivan 's death late in 1808 . During <unk> 's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of <unk> trade with Great Britain and France , then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars . Although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed . 
 Foreign policy played a major role in <unk> 's administration . The legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom ( then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars ) , and <unk> in early 1810 invited Francis James Jackson , who had been rejected as the UK 's ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in President James Madison 's decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackson 's credentials . 
 The <unk> of the war threat , and the choice by the Republicans of the popular Elbridge Gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to <unk> control of Massachusetts in the 1810 elections . The <unk> Gerry and Republican <unk> criticized <unk> for his lavish lifestyle , including his palatial <unk> residence and <unk> activities he organized as governor , and highlighted his <unk> family connections while emphasizing Gerry 's <unk> patriotism . Gerry won the election . Jackson did visit Boston , but he was greeted not by <unk> , but Gerry . <unk> ran against Gerry again in 1811 , but lost in another <unk> campaign . 
 <unk> was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college 's Board of <unk> from 1810 to 1815 and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard 's first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 of <unk> granite , was named in his honor , but was demolished when <unk> Library was built in its place in 1915 . ( This structure is found on the seal of the city of Cambridge . ) One of the residential Winthrop House 's buildings is called <unk> Hall in his honor .

 In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed by Governor Caleb Strong to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd . He served from May 5 , 1813 to May 30 , 1816 , winning reelection to the seat in 1814 . He opposed the ongoing War of 1812 in these years , with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to <unk> interests . He expressed approval of the 1814 Hartford Convention in which the New England states aired grievances concerning Republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war . 
 <unk> <unk> to the Treaty of <unk> that ended the war , but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war . He resigned in June 1816 , unhappy with the politics of Washington and suffering from poor health . Although he was no longer active in politics , he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day , opposing the 1820 Missouri <unk> and <unk> the " great <unk> & <unk> " of <unk> Governor John Brooks .

 <unk> remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was active in a number of organizations , including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society ( whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 ) . He was also elected a member of the American <unk> Society in 1814 . <unk> spent most of his later years at his country estate in <unk> , suffering from worsening <unk> <unk> that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene in <unk> led him in 1822 to return to Boston in the winters . He died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its <unk> <unk> Ground . 
 <unk> 's wife died in 1834 ; the couple had no children . The major <unk> of the <unk> estate was Harvard ( which received an estimated $ 100 @,@ 000 ) , although <unk> were also made to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society . The <unk> estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time . The mansion was saved from demolition by the <unk> Place Society ( established for the purpose of preserving it ) , which now operates it as a museum . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 .

 <unk> ( / <unk> / ; Latin : <unk> Claudius Caesar Augustus <unk> ; 15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 , and the last in the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty . <unk> was adopted by his grand @-@ uncle Claudius to become his heir and successor , and succeeded to the throne in 54 following Claudius ' death . 
 <unk> focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and enhancing the cultural life of the empire , but according to the historian <unk> he was viewed by the Roman people as <unk> and corrupt . He ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games . During his reign , the <unk> general <unk> conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the <unk> Empire . His general <unk> <unk> crushed a revolt in Britain . <unk> annexed the <unk> Kingdom to the empire and began the First Jewish – Roman War . 
 In 64 AD , most of Rome was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome , which many Romans believed <unk> himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex , the <unk> <unk> . In 68 , the rebellion of <unk> in Gaul and later the acclamation of <unk> in <unk> drove <unk> from the throne . Facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed , he committed suicide on 9 June 68 ( the first Roman emperor to do so ) . His death ended the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty , sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four <unk> . <unk> 's rule is often associated with <unk> and extravagance . He is known for many executions , including that of his mother , and the probable murder by poison of his <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> was <unk> to have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light . This view is based on the writings of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the main surviving sources for <unk> 's reign , but a few surviving sources paint <unk> in a more favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , especially in the East . Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on <unk> 's <unk> acts .

 Lucius <unk> <unk> , <unk> , was born on 15 December 37 in <unk> ( modern <unk> and <unk> ) , near Rome . He was the only son of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the Younger , sister of Emperor <unk> . 
 <unk> 's father , <unk> , was the son of Lucius <unk> <unk> ( consul 16 BC ) and <unk> Major . <unk> was thus the grandson of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( consul 32 BC ) and probably <unk> <unk> on his father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother 's side . Thus , <unk> had as his paternal grandmother <unk> Major , and also claimed more remote descent from <unk> Minor as a great @-@ grandson — later grandson after Claudius adopted him . 
 Through Octavia , <unk> was the great @-@ nephew of Caesar Augustus . <unk> 's father had been employed as a <unk> and was a member of <unk> 's staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think <unk> refers to Augustus 's adopted son <unk> Caesar here , but this is not likely ) . 
 <unk> 's father was described by <unk> as a murderer and a <unk> who was charged by Emperor <unk> with treason , adultery and <unk> . <unk> died , allowing him to escape these charges . <unk> 's father died of <unk> ( " <unk> " ) in 39 when <unk> was two .

 <unk> was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle , <unk> , had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir . <unk> 's mother , <unk> , lost favour with <unk> and was exiled in 39 after her husband 's death . <unk> seized <unk> 's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt , <unk> <unk> , who was the mother of Valeria <unk> , Claudius 's third wife . <unk> , his wife <unk> and their infant daughter Julia <unk> were murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius , <unk> 's uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowed <unk> to return from exile . 
 Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria <unk> . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , <unk> , who died at a young age . He had two children with <unk> – <unk> Octavia ( born 40 ) and <unk> ( born 41 ) . <unk> was executed by Claudius in the year 48 . 
 In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to <unk> 's mother <unk> , despite her being his niece . To aid Claudius politically , young <unk> was adopted in 50 and took the name <unk> Claudius Caesar <unk> <unk> ( see adoption in Rome ) . <unk> was older than his <unk> <unk> , and thus became heir to the throne . 
 <unk> was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed <unk> , entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his <unk> <unk> Octavia .

 Claudius died in 54 and <unk> , taking the name <unk> Claudius Caesar Augustus <unk> , was established as Emperor . Though accounts vary , many ancient historians state <unk> poisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how much <unk> knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius . 
 <unk> wrote " ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death , he was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to <unk> mushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , " as the Greek <unk> has it . At any rate , after Claudius ' death he vented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now with <unk> and now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mortals , <unk> the first syllable of the word <unk> , and he <unk> many of his decrees and acts as the work of a <unk> and a <unk> . Finally , he neglected to <unk> the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall . " 
 According to <unk> ; <unk> became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor at that time Although , what <unk> may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth , also listed by <unk> , would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death . <unk> , in book XIII of his Annals , describes <unk> as being ' scarcely out of his <unk> ' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe <unk> 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , <unk> , his tutor Lucius <unk> Seneca , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in the first year . Other tutors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of <unk> . 
 Very early in <unk> 's rule , problems arose from competition for influence between <unk> and <unk> 's two main advisers , Seneca and <unk> . <unk> also attempted to influence the young <unk> . <unk> also is mentioned by ancient sources as " <unk> for her son ( <unk> ) " . This <unk> continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them . It is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world . It is because of this position of power <unk> felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in <unk> 's court as he offered the advice <unk> wanted to hear unlike his mother . 
 In 54 , <unk> tried to sit down next to <unk> while he met with an Armenian envoy , but Seneca stopped her and prevented a <unk> scene ( as it was <unk> at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business ) . <unk> 's friends also <unk> <unk> and told <unk> to <unk> of his mother . 
 <unk> was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with <unk> <unk> , a former slave . In 55 , <unk> attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss <unk> . <unk> , with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs . 
 With <unk> 's influence over her son severed , she reportedly began pushing for <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , to become emperor . Nearly fourteen @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , heir @-@ designate prior to <unk> 's adoption , was still legally a minor , but was approaching legal adulthood . According to <unk> , <unk> hoped that with her support , <unk> , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over <unk> . However , the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55 , the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set . 
 <unk> claimed that <unk> died from an <unk> seizure , but ancient historians all claim <unk> ' death came from <unk> 's poisoning him . <unk> , he enlisted the services of <unk> , a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons . She devised a mixture to kill <unk> , but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave , <unk> angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable . <unk> then devised a new <unk> that she promised would " kill <unk> than a viper . " 
 Her promise was fulfilled after <unk> consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been <unk> , and succumbed within minutes . After the death of <unk> , <unk> was accused of <unk> Octavia and <unk> ordered her out of the imperial residence . 
 
 = = = <unk> and consolidation of power = = = 
 
 Over time , <unk> became progressively more powerful , freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas , an ally of <unk> , from his position in the treasury . Pallas , along with <unk> , was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring <unk> <unk> to the throne . Seneca was accused of having relations with <unk> and <unk> . Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas and <unk> acquitted . According to <unk> <unk> , at this time , Seneca and <unk> reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere <unk> of <unk> . 
 In 58 , <unk> became romantically involved with <unk> <unk> , the wife of his friend and future emperor <unk> . Reportedly because a marriage to <unk> and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with <unk> alive , <unk> ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as <unk> did not marry <unk> until 62 . 
 Additionally , according to <unk> , <unk> did not divorce her husband until after <unk> 's death , making it unlikely that the already married <unk> would be pressing <unk> for marriage . Some modern historians <unk> that <unk> 's execution of <unk> was prompted by her plotting to set <unk> <unk> on the throne . According to <unk> , <unk> tried to kill his mother through a <unk> planned by his <unk> tutor <unk> . Instead , it took the life of <unk> 's friend , <unk> <unk> . When <unk> survived , he had her executed by <unk> and framed it as a suicide . The incident is also recorded by <unk> . 
 In 62 , <unk> 's adviser , <unk> , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with <unk> charges . Seneca asked <unk> for permission to retire from public affairs . <unk> divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant <unk> . After public protests , <unk> was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return . 
 <unk> also was reported to have kicked <unk> to death in 65 before she could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's possible bias against <unk> and the likelihood that they did not have <unk> accounts of private events , <unk> that <unk> may have died because of complications of <unk> or childbirth . 
 <unk> of treason being plotted against <unk> and the Senate first appeared in 62 . The Senate ruled that <unk> , a <unk> , should be put to death for speaking ill of <unk> at a party . Later , <unk> ordered the exile of <unk> <unk> who <unk> the Senate in a book . <unk> writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by <unk> <unk> <unk> began in this year . To consolidate power , <unk> executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . According to <unk> , <unk> " showed neither discrimination nor <unk> in putting to death <unk> he pleased " during this period . 
 <unk> 's consolidation of power also included a slow <unk> of authority from the Senate . In 54 , <unk> promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , <unk> complained that they had no power left and this led to the <unk> conspiracy .

 When <unk> 's wife <unk> <unk> died in 65 , <unk> went into deep mourning . Her body was not <unk> , it was <unk> with spices , embalmed and put in the <unk> of Augustus . She was given a state funeral . <unk> praised her during the funeral <unk> and gave her divine honors . It is said that <unk> " burned ten years ' worth of Arabia 's incense production at her funeral . 
 In the beginning of 66 , he married <unk> <unk> . She was already married when she became <unk> 's mistress in 65 AD , with <unk> 's husband being driven to suicide in 66 , so <unk> could marry <unk> . She was one of the few of <unk> 's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign . 
 In 67 , <unk> ordered a young <unk> , <unk> , to be <unk> and then married him . According to Dion <unk> , <unk> bore an <unk> resemblance to <unk> , and <unk> even called him by his dead wife 's name .

 Over the course of his reign , <unk> often made <unk> that pleased the lower class . <unk> was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity . 
 <unk> began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy . In this first year , he forbade others to refer to him with regard to <unk> , for which he was praised by the Senate . <unk> was known for spending his time visiting <unk> and <unk> during this period . 
 In 55 , <unk> began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well of <unk> and contrast it with his later rule . 
 Under <unk> , restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discussion in the Senate on the <unk> of the freedmen class , and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of <unk> freedom . <unk> supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right . 
 The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite riots from the people , <unk> supported the Senate on their measure , and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case . 
 After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor , <unk> transferred collection authority to lower commissioners . <unk> banned any magistrate or <unk> from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace . Additionally , there were many <unk> and <unk> of government officials along with arrests for <unk> and corruption . 
 When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly <unk> , <unk> attempted to repeal all indirect taxes . The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury . As a compromise , taxes were cut from 4 @.@ 5 % to 2 @.@ 5 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . To lower the cost of food imports , merchant ships were declared tax @-@ exempt . 
 In imitation of the Greeks , <unk> built a number of <unk> and theatres . <unk> <unk> shows were also held . <unk> also established the <unk> <unk> . The festival included games , poetry , and theater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to <unk> . Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned . Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment . 
 In 64 , Rome burned . <unk> enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A number of other major construction projects occurred in <unk> 's late reign . <unk> had the marshes of <unk> filled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large <unk> <unk> . In 67 , <unk> attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of <unk> . Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State 's budget . 
 The cost to rebuild Rome was immense , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . <unk> <unk> the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire 's history . He reduced the weight of the <unk> from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( 3 @.@ 85 grams to 3 @.@ 35 grams ) . He also reduced the silver purity from 99 @.@ 5 % to 93 @.@ 5 % — the silver weight dropping from 3 @.@ 83 grams to 3 @.@ 4 grams . Furthermore , <unk> reduced the weight of the <unk> from 40 per Roman pound to 45 ( 8 grams to 7 @.@ 2 grams ) . 
 Between 62 and 67 , according to <unk> the Elder and Seneca , <unk> promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River . It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history . However , <unk> 's expedition up the Nile failed upon reaching the impenetrable <unk> of present @-@ day South Sudan . 
 The economic policy of <unk> is a point of debate among scholars . According to ancient historians , <unk> 's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of <unk> under <unk> left Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , though , note that the period was riddled with <unk> and that it is likely that <unk> 's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles . 
 
 = = = Great Fire of Rome ( 64 AD ) = = = 
 
 The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64 . The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus <unk> in shops selling flammable goods . 
 The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to <unk> , who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and burned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven . The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period ( including <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) make no mention of it in what remains of their work . 
 It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or <unk> . <unk> and <unk> <unk> favor <unk> as the <unk> , so he could build a palatial complex . <unk> mentions that Christians confessed to the crime , but it is not known whether these <unk> were induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 . 
 It was said by <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> sang the " <unk> of <unk> " in stage costume while the city burned . Popular legend claims that <unk> played the <unk> at the time of the fire , an anachronism based merely on the concept of the <unk> , a <unk> instrument associated with <unk> and his performances . ( The <unk> was not invented until the 10th century . ) <unk> 's account , however , has <unk> in <unk> at the time of the fire . <unk> also said that <unk> playing his <unk> and singing while the city burned was only rumor . 
 According to <unk> , upon hearing news of the fire , <unk> returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , which he paid for from his own funds . <unk> 's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the <unk> , spending days searching the debris without even his <unk> . After the fire , <unk> opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors . 
 In the wake of the fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick , and faced by <unk> on wide roads . <unk> also built a new palace complex known as the <unk> <unk> in an area cleared by the fire . This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30 @-@ meter @-@ tall statue of himself , the <unk> of <unk> . The size of this complex is debated ( from 100 to 300 acres ) . To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire . 
 <unk> , in one of the earliest non @-@ Christian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for a <unk> and rumors held <unk> responsible . To <unk> blame , <unk> targeted Christians . He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others were <unk> and burned .

 <unk> enjoyed driving a one @-@ horse chariot , singing to the <unk> and poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by other <unk> throughout the empire . At first , <unk> only performed for a private audience . 
 In 64 AD . , <unk> began singing in public in <unk> in order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second <unk> <unk> in 65 . It was said that <unk> <unk> the attention , but historians also write that <unk> was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it <unk> . 
 <unk> was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , <unk> raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though <unk> <unk> in his racing ( in one case , dropping out entirely before the end ) and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless and <unk> them when he returned to Rome . The victories are attributed to <unk> <unk> the judges and his status as emperor . 
 
 = = = War and peace with <unk> = = = 
 
 Shortly after <unk> 's accession to the throne in 54 , the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia <unk> their Iberian prince <unk> and he was replaced with the <unk> prince <unk> . This was seen as a <unk> invasion of Roman territory . There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation . <unk> reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome . 
 The peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out in 58 . The <unk> king <unk> I refused to remove his brother <unk> from Armenia . The <unk> began a full @-@ scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom . Commander <unk> responded and repelled most of the <unk> army that same year . <unk> retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia . 
 <unk> was acclaimed in public for this initial victory . <unk> , a <unk> noble raised in Rome , was installed by <unk> as the new ruler of Armenia . <unk> was appointed governor of Syria as a reward . 
 In 62 , <unk> invaded the <unk> province of <unk> . Again , Rome and <unk> were at war and this continued until 63 . <unk> began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria . <unk> tried to convince <unk> to continue the war , but <unk> opted for a peace deal instead . There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit . 
 The result was a deal where <unk> again became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor <unk> . In the future , the king of Armenia was to be a <unk> prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . <unk> was forced to come to Rome and <unk> in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance . 
 This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for <unk> politically . <unk> became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the <unk> as well . The peace between <unk> and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 . 
 
 = = = Other major power struggles and rebellions = = = 
 
 The war with <unk> was not <unk> 's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors , <unk> faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire . 
 British <unk> of 60 – 61 ( <unk> 's Uprising ) 
 In 60 , a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia . While the governor <unk> <unk> <unk> and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona ( Anglesey ) from the <unk> , the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen <unk> of the <unk> . <unk> and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of <unk> could return , receive reinforcements , and quell the rebellion in 61 . Fearing <unk> himself would provoke further rebellion , <unk> replaced him with the more passive <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 The <unk> <unk> of 65 
 In 65 , <unk> <unk> <unk> , a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy against <unk> with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> and a <unk> of the <unk> Guard . According to <unk> , many conspirators wished to " rescue the state " from the emperor and restore the Republic . The <unk> <unk> discovered the conspiracy and reported it to <unk> 's secretary , <unk> . As a result , the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including <unk> , the poet . <unk> 's previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators . 
 The First Jewish War of 66 – 70 
 In 66 , there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension . In 67 , <unk> dispatched <unk> to restore order . This revolt was eventually put down in 70 , after <unk> 's death . This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem . 
 
 = = = The revolt of <unk> and <unk> and the death of <unk> = = = 
 
 In March 68 , <unk> Julius <unk> , the governor of Gallia <unk> , rebelled against <unk> 's tax policies . Lucius <unk> Rufus , the governor of <unk> Superior , was ordered to put down <unk> 's rebellion . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province , <unk> called upon <unk> <unk> <unk> , the governor of <unk> <unk> , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to <unk> . 
 At the Battle of <unk> in May 68 , <unk> ' forces easily defeated those of <unk> and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , <unk> ' <unk> attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor . <unk> refused to act against <unk> , but the discontent of the <unk> of Germany and the continued opposition of <unk> in Spain did not <unk> well for him . 
 While <unk> had retained some control of the situation , support for <unk> increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of the <unk> Guard , <unk> <unk> <unk> , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for <unk> . 
 In response , <unk> fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of <unk> and , from there , to take a fleet to one of the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces . According to <unk> , <unk> abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from <unk> 's <unk> : " Is it so <unk> a thing then to die ? " <unk> then <unk> with the idea of fleeing to <unk> , throwing himself upon the mercy of <unk> , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could not <unk> their hearts , to <unk> them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt " . <unk> reports that the text of this speech was later found in <unk> 's writing desk , but that he <unk> not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the <unk> . 
 <unk> returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he <unk> at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . <unk> messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for a <unk> or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor <unk> ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber . 
 Returning , <unk> sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial <unk> , <unk> , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise , <unk> and four loyal freedmen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , reached the villa , where <unk> ordered them to dig a grave for him . 
 At this time , a <unk> arrived with a report that the Senate had declared <unk> a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the <unk> . The Senate actually was still reluctant and <unk> on the right course of action as <unk> was the last member of the Julio @-@ <unk> Family . Indeed , most of the <unk> had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not to <unk> himself . The men actually had the goal of returning <unk> back to the Senate , where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the <unk> governors that would preserve <unk> 's life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced . 
 <unk> , however , did not know this , and at the news brought by the <unk> , he prepared himself for suicide , pacing up and down <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " which translates to English as " What an artist dies in me . " <unk> his <unk> , he first <unk> for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself . At last , the sound of approaching horsemen drove <unk> to face the end . However , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , <unk> , to perform the task . 
 When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeing <unk> all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . <unk> 's final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Octavia , and was buried in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in what is now the Villa <unk> ( <unk> Hill ) area of Rome . 
 With his death , the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declared <unk> a public enemy to appease the coming <unk> ( as the Senate had initially declared <unk> as a public enemy ) and proclaimed <unk> the new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four <unk> . 
 
 = = = Post mortem = = = 
 
 According to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the people of Rome celebrated the death of <unk> . <unk> , though , describes a more complicated political environment . <unk> mentions that <unk> 's death was welcomed by Senators , nobility and the upper class . The lower @-@ class , slaves , <unk> of the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excesses of <unk> " , on the other hand , were upset with the news . Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to <unk> , but were <unk> to overthrow him . 
 Eastern sources , namely <unk> II and <unk> of <unk> , mention that <unk> 's death was <unk> as he " restored the liberties of <unk> with a wisdom and <unk> quite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . " 
 Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed <unk> 's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , for <unk> and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . " 
 <unk> 's name was erased from some monuments , in what Edward <unk> regards as an " outburst of private zeal " . Many portraits of <unk> were reworked to represent other figures ; according to Eric R. <unk> , over fifty such images survive . This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> , however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of <unk> long after his death . 
 The civil war during the year of the Four <unk> was described by ancient historians as a <unk> period . According to <unk> , this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline , as <unk> and those before him could . <unk> began his short reign with the execution of many allies of <unk> and possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> , who claimed to be the son of Emperor <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of <unk> 's and resembled him somewhat in temperament . It was said that the common Roman hailed <unk> as <unk> himself . <unk> used " <unk> " as a surname and <unk> many statues to <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> began his reign with a large funeral for <unk> complete with songs written by <unk> . 
 After <unk> 's suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . This belief came to be known as the <unk> <unk> Legend . 
 The legend of <unk> 's return lasted for hundreds of years after <unk> 's death . Augustine of <unk> wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422 . 
 At least three <unk> <unk> emerged leading rebellions . The first , who sang and played the <unk> or <unk> and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor , appeared in 69 during the reign of <unk> . After persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed . <unk> during the reign of Titus ( 79 – 81 ) , another <unk> appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the <unk> and looked like <unk> but he , too , was killed . Twenty years after <unk> 's death , during the reign of <unk> , there was a third <unk> . He was supported by the <unk> , who only <unk> gave him up , and the matter almost came to war .

 In his book The Lives of the Twelve <unk> , <unk> describes <unk> as " about the average height , his body marked with spots and <unk> , his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender . " 
 
 = = Historiography = = 
 
 The history of <unk> 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with <unk> . These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and <unk> , either overly critical or praising of <unk> . The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on <unk> written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . <unk> <unk> , <unk> Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on <unk> that are now lost . There were also pro @-@ <unk> histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what <unk> <unk> was praised . 
 The bulk of what is known of <unk> comes from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who were all of the <unk> class . <unk> and <unk> wrote their histories on <unk> over fifty years after his death , while <unk> <unk> wrote his history over 150 years after <unk> 's death . These sources contradict on a number of events in <unk> 's life including the death of Claudius , the death of <unk> , and the Roman fire of 64 , but they are consistent in their condemnation of <unk> . 
 A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on <unk> . Few surviving sources paint <unk> in a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east . 
 <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> ( c . 155 – <unk> ) was the son of <unk> <unk> , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public service . He was a senator under <unk> and governor of <unk> after the death of Septimius <unk> ; and afterwards <unk> consul around 205 , and also <unk> in Africa and <unk> . 
 Books 61 – 63 of <unk> 's Roman History describe the reign of <unk> . Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John <unk> , an 11th @-@ century monk .

 <unk> <unk> ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy with <unk> and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They <unk> for his rule once he was gone and embraced <unk> when they appeared : 
 Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . He makes a few passing negative comments on <unk> 's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describes <unk> as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man . 
 <unk> 
 The historian <unk> ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling <unk> a <unk> , was also the first to mention bias against <unk> . Of other historians , he said : 
 But I <unk> any further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of <unk> ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so <unk> <unk> against him with their lies , that they <unk> deserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of <unk> , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them . 
 <unk> 
 Though more of a poet than historian , <unk> ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one of the <unk> accounts of <unk> 's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under <unk> in contrast to previous war and <unk> . Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow <unk> and was executed . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> II " the <unk> " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of <unk> in the Life of <unk> <unk> ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of <unk> , he speaks of others ' positive reception of <unk> in the East . 
 Pliny the Elder 
 The history of <unk> by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are several references to <unk> in Pliny 's Natural <unk> . Pliny has one of the worst opinions of <unk> and calls him an " enemy of mankind . " 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions <unk> indirectly in his account of the Life of <unk> and the Life of <unk> . <unk> is portrayed as a <unk> , but those that replace him are not described as better . 
 Seneca the Younger 
 It is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65 ) , <unk> 's teacher and advisor , writes very well of <unk> . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the <unk> order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position , <unk> started writing biographies of the emperors , <unk> the <unk> and sensational aspects . 
 <unk> 
 The Annals by <unk> ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of <unk> , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . <unk> described the rule of the Julio @-@ <unk> emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was <unk> : 
 The histories of <unk> , <unk> , Claudius and <unk> , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred . 
 <unk> was the son of a <unk> , who married into the elite family of <unk> . He entered his political life as a senator after <unk> 's death and , by <unk> ' own admission , owed much to <unk> 's rivals . <unk> that this bias may be apparent to others , <unk> protests that his writing is true .

 At the end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea . According to the Talmud , <unk> went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . The child responded , " I will lay my vengeance upon <unk> by the hand of my people Israel " ( <unk> . 25 @,@ 14 ) . <unk> became <unk> , believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out . <unk> said , " He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such <unk> . <unk> was then dispatched to put down the rebellion . 
 The Talmud adds that the sage <unk> <unk> Baal <unk> , Rabbi <unk> or Rabbi <unk> Baal <unk> ( Rabbi <unk> the miracle maker ) was a Jewish sage who lived in the time of the <unk> a prominent supporter of the Bar <unk> rebellion against Roman rule .

 Non @-@ Christian historian <unk> describes <unk> extensively <unk> and executing Christians after the fire of 64 . <unk> also mentions <unk> punishing Christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mischievous superstition " and does not connect it with the fire . 
 Christian writer <unk> ( c . 155 – 230 ) was the first to call <unk> the first <unk> of Christians . He wrote , " <unk> your records . There you will find that <unk> was the first that persecuted this doctrine " . <unk> ( c . 240 – 320 ) also said that <unk> " first persecuted the servants of God " . as does <unk> <unk> . However , <unk> writes that , " since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of <unk> , he [ emperor Claudius ] expelled them from Rome " ( " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . These expelled " Jews " may have been early Christians , although <unk> is not explicit .

 The first text to suggest that <unk> ordered the execution of an <unk> is a letter by Clement to the <unk> traditional dated to around 96 <unk> The <unk> Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the <unk> of his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will <unk> the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted . Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean <unk> . 
 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ( c . 275 – <unk> ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of <unk> . He states that <unk> 's persecution led to Peter and Paul 's deaths , but that <unk> did not give any specific orders . However , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to <unk> , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death . 
 Peter is first said to have been <unk> upside @-@ down in Rome during <unk> 's reign ( but not by <unk> ) in the <unk> Acts of Peter ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still alive and <unk> <unk> by God 's command not to <unk> any more Christians .

 The <unk> <unk> , Book 5 and 8 , written in the 2nd century , speak of <unk> returning and bringing destruction . Within Christian communities , these writings , along with others , fueled the belief that <unk> would return as the <unk> . In 310 , <unk> wrote that <unk> " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place of that <unk> wild beast was nowhere to be seen . This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that , having been conveyed to a distant region , he is still reserved alive ; and to him they apply the <unk> verses " , <unk> maintains that it is not right to believe this . 
 In 422 , Augustine of <unk> wrote about 2 <unk> 2 : 1 – 11 , where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the <unk> . Though he rejects the theory , Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that <unk> was the <unk> or would return as the <unk> . He wrote , " so that in saying , ' For the mystery of <unk> <unk> already work , ' he alluded to <unk> , whose <unk> already seemed to be as the <unk> of <unk> . " 
 Some modern biblical scholars such as <unk> <unk> ( Johns Hopkins University ) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study Bibles , contend that the number <unk> in the Book of Revelation is a code for <unk> , a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries . 
 The concept of <unk> as the <unk> is often a central belief of <unk> <unk> .

It had become partly Islamic and Hindu @-@ <unk> by the 15th century CE . 
 In <unk> Spanish <unk> arrived from Mexico , from across the Pacific , and founded present @-@ day Manila in what today is <unk> . Spanish missionaries soon <unk> the city and incorporated <unk> under Manila and then built some of the oldest churches in the country , including San Agustin Church . The <unk> renamed the area <unk> <unk> de <unk> ( New Kingdom of <unk> ) and shortened the name to Manila . 
 Manila became the center of Spanish activity in the Far East and one end of the Manila @-@ Acapulco <unk> trade route , linking Spanish America with Asia , one of the earliest examples of <unk> . Due to the central location in the Pacific sea trade routes , Manila received the moniker of the " Pearl of the <unk> " . Spanish rule of Manila and the entire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries , until 1898 . At different times during the long Spanish period there were local <unk> , Chinese <unk> , massive pirate attacks , great earthquakes , Dutch raids and invasion attempts , and a British occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines . Order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade . In the 19th century Manila was one of the most modern cities in Asia . Before the Spanish – American War , Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution . Under the American rule following the Spanish – American War , the United States changed the official language from Spanish to English and made some changes in education , local laws and urban planning . Towards the end of World War II , during the Battle of Manila most of the city was flattened by intensive aerial bombardment by the United States Air Force . As a result , relatively little remains of Manila 's prewar and colonial architecture , although there are ongoing restoration projects , especially within the old walled city , <unk> .

 The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby <unk> <unk> dated to around 3000 BC . Furthermore , <unk> , a class of <unk> peoples , became the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines . They were found across Luzon before the <unk> @-@ <unk> migrated in and assimilated them . 
 The Kingdom of <unk> flourished during the latter half of the Ming Dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with China . <unk> district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire , with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains , and were addressed variously as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> ( " lords " ) ; <unk> <unk> ( " son of heaven " ) ; or <unk> ( " lord of the palace " ) , the Emperor of China considered the <unk> ( rulers of ancient Manila ) " <unk> " ( Kings ) . 
 In the 13th century , Manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the <unk> River , on top of previous older towns . Manila was then settled by the <unk> empire of <unk> as referenced in the epic <unk> poem <unk> which inscribed its conquest by <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> " <unk> ् <unk> ् " which is a historical name for the city of Manila is listed in <unk> 14 alongside <unk> , which is now <unk> , and <unk> . 
 During the reign of Sultan <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> Empire invaded , wanting to take advantage of <unk> 's China trade by attacking its environs and establishing " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( The Kingdom of <unk> ) . They ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the Sultanate of <unk> as its satellite state . They established a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted Islam and became <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> I. He also established a trading challenge to the already rich House of <unk> <unk> in <unk> . Islam was further strengthened by the arrival of Muslim traders from the Arab @-@ Indian area and Southeast Asia . Manila was temporarily besieged by the invasion of Chinese pirate @-@ warlord <unk> ( <unk> ) but was thwarted by the local inhabitants , before it became the seat of the colonial government of Spain . 
 On June 24 , <unk> , Spanish <unk> Miguel López de <unk> arrived from New Spain ( now Mexico ) , and then exercised rule of the Spanish city of Manila as a territory of New Spain with the establishment of a city council in what today is the district of <unk> . López de <unk> had the local royalty executed or exiled , after the failure of the <unk> <unk> ; a plot wherein an alliance between Japanese merchants , Luzon 's <unk> with several <unk> and <unk> plus the <unk> Empire would band together to execute the Spaniards and their Latin @-@ American mercenaries , and <unk> allies . At the conclusion of which , the victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies and of the Philippines , which the empire would control for the next three centuries , from <unk> to 1898 . 
 Manila then became famous during the Manila @-@ Acapulco <unk> trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia ( Which was already an <unk> for goods coming from India , Indonesia and China ) and trade also flowed vice versa . Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru were exchanged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Southeast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe . Likewise wines and olives grown from Europe and North Africa were <unk> via Mexico towards Manila . 
 Manila was occupied by British forces for twenty months , from <unk> to 1764 , and used as a base for an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines during the Seven Years ' War . Eventually , the British withdrew from Manila as per agreements in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @-@ city of <unk> , mostly populated by Europeans and <unk> , kept its cannons pointed at <unk> , the world 's oldest <unk> . 
 Mexican Independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain . 
 The growing wealth and education attracted indigenous , Chinese , Indians , <unk> , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent <unk> citizenship regardless of ethnicity . The developments also facilitated the rise of an <unk> class which <unk> liberal ideas , the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution which sought independence from Spain . 
 After the Battle of Manila ( 1898 ) , Spain ceded the surrendered city of Manila to the United States . The First Philippine Republic based at nearby <unk> fought against the Americans for control of the city of Manila . The Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured president Emilio <unk> who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 . 
 Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been tacit : that the City of Manila was not <unk> alone but also all its <unk> . The new city charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably <unk> , <unk> , Santa Cruz , <unk> , San Miguel , <unk> , Santa <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as <unk> — namely , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , Santa Mesa and <unk> . Later times would add two more : <unk> and San Andres <unk> . 
 Under American control , a new civilian oriented Insular Government headed by then Governor @-@ General William Howard Taft invited city <unk> Daniel <unk> for the transformation of Manila , to adapt the old city to changed times and modern needs . The <unk> Plan included development of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation , and <unk> of Manila with the improvement of <unk> , construction of parks , <unk> and various building for various activities . 
 The latter included a government center occupying all of Wallace Field , which extends from <unk> to the present Taft Avenue . The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing toward the sea , and would form , with the buildings of different government <unk> and departments , a <unk> , <unk> in the center , and a monument to José <unk> at its <unk> end . Of <unk> 's proposed government center , only three units — the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II erupted . 
 Due to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , American soldiers were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations were removed on December 24 , 1941 . General Douglas MacArthur declared Manila an open city to prevent further death and destruction ; despite this , the Japanese <unk> continued to bomb the city . Manila was occupied by the Japanese forces on January 2 , 1942 . 
 Manila was also the site of the <unk> battle in the Pacific theater during the Second World War . After falling to the Empire of Japan on January 2 , 1942 , it was recaptured by joint American and <unk> troops from February 3 to March 3 , 1945 . Some 100 @,@ 000 civilians were killed in Manila in February 1945 . It was the second most devastated city in the world after Warsaw during the Second World War . At the end of World War II , almost all of the structures in the city , particularly <unk> , were destroyed but after the war , reconstruction took place . 
 In 1948 , President <unk> <unk> moved the seat of government of the Philippines to <unk> City , a new capital city in the suburbs and fields northeast of Manila , created in 1938 by former President Manuel L. <unk> , which was named after him . The move ended any implementation of the <unk> Plan 's intent for the government centre to be at <unk> . 
 With the <unk> @-@ born <unk> <unk> as its first elected mayor in 1952 ( all mayors were appointed prior to this ) , Manila underwent The Golden Age , once again earning its status as the " Pearl of the <unk> " , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After <unk> 's term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio <unk> for most of the 1960s . Ramon <unk> ( an Indian @-@ <unk> ) was mayor for nearly the entire 1970s until the 1986 People Power Revolution . <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are often collectively considered as the " Big Three of Manila " less for their rather long <unk> as the city 's chief executive ( continuously for over three decades , from 1952 – 1986 ) , but more for their <unk> contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in <unk> the quality of life and welfare of the people of Manila . 
 During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential <unk> No. <unk> on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a separate regional unit of government . On the <unk> anniversary of the city 's foundation on June 24 , 1976 , Manila was reinstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . Presidential <unk> No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the <unk> people and in the eyes of the world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture . 
 During the martial law era , Manila became a hot @-@ bed of resistance activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and military which were <unk> to the Marcos regime . After decades of resistance , the non @-@ violent People Power Revolution ( predecessor to the peaceful @-@ <unk> that toppled the iron @-@ curtain in Europe ) , ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power . 
 In 1992 , <unk> Lim was elected mayor , the first Chinese @-@ <unk> to hold the office . He was known for his anti @-@ crime <unk> . Lim was succeeded by <unk> <unk> , who served as his vice @-@ mayor . <unk> was known for his campaign ( and city slogan ) " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> Manila ) , which saw the establishment of several parks and the repair and rehabilitation of the city 's deteriorating facilities . He was the city 's mayor for 3 terms ( 9 years ) before being termed out of office . 
 <unk> Lim once again ran for mayor and defeated <unk> 's son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of <unk> 's projects claiming <unk> 's projects made little contribution to the improvements of the city . The relationship of both parties turned bitter , with the two <unk> again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against <unk> . 
 Lim was sued by <unk> Dennis <unk> on 2008 over human rights , charged with <unk> over the rehabilitation of public schools , and was heavily criticized for his <unk> resolution of the <unk> Park hostage taking incident , one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Philippines . Later on , Vice Mayor <unk> <unk> and 28 city <unk> filed another case against Lim in 2012 , stating that Lim 's statement in a meeting were " life @-@ threatening " to them . On the 2013 elections , former President Joseph <unk> defeated Lim in the mayoral race . During his term , <unk> has paid the city 's over <unk> 5 billion debts , increase revenues by 2 @.@ 35 times from <unk> 6 @.@ 2 billion in 2012 to <unk> 14 @.@ 6 billion by 2016 , spent from 2013 to 2016 an unprecedented <unk> 6 @.@ 76 billion for the city 's infrastructure , built and or renovated seven city public markets , built 22 schools , increased teachers ' <unk> , modernized the six city hospitals and bought <unk> machines and magnetic resonance imaging <unk> , increased the efficiency of the police force and reduced crime . Manila has become the most competitive city in the Philippines by 2015 , making the city the best place for doing business and for living in . 
 Despite his achievements and unprecedented feat as the Mayor of Manila , however , <unk> was re @-@ elected as Manila mayor in the 2016 election against Lim and <unk> <unk> , only winning by an <unk> 2 @,@ 830 votes .

The National Museum of the Philippines Complex , which include the National Museum of Fine Arts , Museum of Anthropology and the Museum of Natural History , is located on the northeast part of <unk> Park facing Taft <unk> proposed national government center during the American time . Museums established by educational institutions include the <unk> Shrine , the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design , <unk> Museum of Arts and Sciences , and the UP Museum of a History of <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> , one of Manila 's most prominent museums , documents the Chinese lives and contributions in the history of the Philippines . The <unk> Light and Sound Museum chronicles the <unk> desire for freedom during the revolution under <unk> 's leadership and other revolutionary leaders . The Metropolitan Museum of Manila exhibits the <unk> arts and culture . 
 Other museums in the city are the Museum of Manila , the city @-@ owned museum that exhibits the city 's culture and history , <unk> <unk> , a children 's museum , the Museum of Philippine Political History , which exhibits notable political events in the country , the Parish of the Our Lady of the <unk> and the San Agustin Church Museum , which houses religious artifacts , and Plaza San Luis , a public museum . 
 
 = = Sports = = 
 
 Sports in Manila have a long and distinguished history . The city 's , and in general the country 's main sport is basketball , and most <unk> have a makeshift basketball court , with court markings drawn on the streets . Larger <unk> have covered courts where <unk> leagues are held every summer ( April to May ) . 
 The city has several well @-@ known sports venues , such as the <unk> Memorial Sports Complex and San Andres <unk> , the home of the now defunct Manila <unk> . The <unk> Memorial Sports Complex houses the <unk> Memorial Track and Football Stadium , the Baseball Stadium , Tennis Courts , Memorial Coliseum and the <unk> <unk> Stadium ( the latter two are indoor arenas ) . 
 The <unk> complex had hosted several multi @-@ sport events , such as the 1954 Asian Games and the 1934 Far Eastern Games . Whenever the country hosts the Southeast Asian Games , most of the events are held at the complex , but in the 2005 Games , most events were held elsewhere . The 1960 ABC Championship and the 1973 ABC Championship , <unk> of the FIBA Asia Championship , was hosted by the complex , with the national basketball team winning on both tournaments . The 1978 FIBA World Championship was held at the complex although the latter stages were held in the <unk> Coliseum in <unk> City , Southeast Asia 's largest indoor arena at that time . 
 Manila also hosts several well @-@ known sports facilities such as the Enrique M. <unk> Sports Center and the University of Santo Tomas Sports Complex , both of which are private venues owned by a university ; collegiate sports are also held , with the University Athletic Association of the Philippines and the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball games held at <unk> Memorial Coliseum and <unk> <unk> Stadium , although basketball events had transferred to San Juan 's <unk> Flying V Arena and the <unk> Coliseum in <unk> City . Other collegiate sports are still held at the <unk> Memorial Sports Complex . Professional basketball also used to play at the city , but the Philippine Basketball Association now holds their games at <unk> Coliseum and <unk> <unk> at <unk> ; the now defunct Philippine Basketball League played some of their games at the <unk> Memorial Sports Complex . 
 The Manila Storm are the city 's rugby league team training at <unk> Park ( <unk> Park ) and playing their matches at Southern Plains Field , <unk> , <unk> . 
 Previously a widely played sport in the city , Manila is now the home of the only sizable baseball stadium in the country , at the <unk> Memorial Baseball Stadium . The stadium hosts games of Baseball Philippines ; Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth were the first players to score a home run at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2 , 1934 . 
 Another popular sport in the city are cue sports , and <unk> halls are a feature in most <unk> . The 2010 World Cup of Pool was held at <unk> Place Manila . 
 The <unk> Memorial Track and Football Stadium hosted the first FIFA World Cup <unk> in decades when the Philippines hosted Sri Lanka in July 2011 . The stadium , which was previously unfit for international matches , had undergone a major renovation program prior to the match . The Football Stadium now regularly hosts matches of the United Football League . The stadium also hosted its first rugby test when it hosted the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division I tournaments . 
 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 
 The government of Manila is divided into three branches : executive , legislative and judiciary . The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines under the Metro Manila judicial region . The city government have control of the executive and legislative branch . Manila employs 11 @,@ <unk> personnel at the end of 2014 . 
 The current Mayor of Manila is Joseph <unk> , who served as the President of the Philippines from 1998 @-@ 2001 . He is also the head of the executive department of the city . The legislative arm which is composed of six elected city <unk> , is headed by the Vice Mayor . Former actor <unk> <unk> currently serves as the city 's vice mayor . <unk> they are assisted by the Manila City Council , the local President of the Association of <unk> Captains , and the President of the <unk> <unk> . Their offices are located at the Manila City Hall . 
 
 = = = Finance = = = 
 
 On September 25 , 2014 , the Commission on <unk> released its 2013 Annual Financial Report citing the city 's income at <unk> 10 @.@ 1 billion with an asset worth of <unk> 18 @.@ 6 billion . Its local income stood at <unk> 5 @.@ 41 billion and its national government allocation was <unk> 1 @.@ 74 billion , having an annual regular income ( <unk> ) of an estimated <unk> 7 @.@ 15 billion . Manila 's net income stood at <unk> 3 @.@ 54 billion in 2014 . 
 Among the local government units , Manila has the highest budget allocation to health . It was also one of the cities with the highest tax and internal revenue . Tax revenue accounts for 46 % of the city 's income in 2012 .

 Manila has six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city 's representatives to the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines and of the regular members to the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ; City Council ) . Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and six <unk> members to the council . The city , along with the rest of the nation , elects 12 <unk> as one at @-@ large district . 
 Manila is politically divided into <unk> <unk> , the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines . Each <unk> has its own <unk> and <unk> . For administrative convenience , all the <unk> in Manila are grouped into 100 zones . These zones have no form of local government . 
 The 1st District ( 2015 population : 415 @,@ <unk> ) is Manila 's ( and the country 's ) most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion of <unk> that lies along Manila Bay . 
 The 2nd District ( 2015 population : 215 @,@ 457 ) covers the eastern inland portion of <unk> , a neighborhood or sub @-@ district known as <unk> . 
 The 3rd District ( 2015 population : 197 @,@ 242 ) covers <unk> , <unk> , San Nicolas and Santa Cruz . 
 The 4th District ( 2015 population : 265 @,@ <unk> ) covers <unk> . 
 The 5th District ( 2015 population : 366 @,@ <unk> ) covers <unk> , <unk> , Port Area , <unk> , San Andres <unk> , and a portion of <unk> ( except Zone 90 ) . 
 The 6th District ( 2007 population : 295 @,@ 245 ) covers <unk> ( Zone 90 only ) , <unk> , San Miguel , Santa <unk> and Santa Mesa . 
 Manila has the most number of <unk> of any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — <unk> <unk> , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number from <unk> to 150 by merging existing <unk> , because of the failure to hold a <unk> . 
 
 = = = National government = = = 
 
 Manila , being the seat of political power of the Philippines , has several national government offices headquartered at the city . Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of American colonization to the country when they envisioned a well @-@ designed city outside the walls of <unk> . The strategic location chosen was <unk> , a former town which is now the <unk> Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel <unk> to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington <unk> .. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. <unk> . 
 A new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila , or what is now <unk> City . Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in <unk> City but several key government offices still reside in Manila . However , many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations . 
 The city , as the capital , still hosts the Office of the President , as well as the president 's official residence . Aside from these , important institutions such as the Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> and Management , Finance , Health , Justice , Labor and <unk> and Public Works and Highways still call the city home . Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library , National Archives , National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital . 
 Congress previously held office at the Old Congress Building . In 1972 , due to declaration of martial law , Congress was dissolved ; its successor , the unicameral <unk> <unk> , held office at the new <unk> <unk> Complex . When a new constitution restored the <unk> Congress , the House of Representatives stayed at the <unk> <unk> Complex , while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building . In May 1997 , the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at <unk> .

 Water services used to be provided by the Metropolitan <unk> and <unk> System , which served 30 % of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains , <unk> tanks , or open canals . <unk> was <unk> in 1997 which split the water concession into the east and west zones . The <unk> Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part . It now provides the supply and delivery of <unk> water and <unk> system in Manila , but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water . Electric services are provided by <unk> , the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila . 
 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 
 One of the more famous modes of transportation in Manila is the <unk> . <unk> after U.S. army <unk> , these have been in use since the years immediately following World War II . The <unk> <unk> , the third generation Toyota <unk> , which competed directly with <unk> and followed fixed routes for a set price , once plied the streets of Manila . 
 On a for @-@ hire basis , the city is served by numerous <unk> , " <unk> " ( <unk> with <unk> , the Philippine version of the auto <unk> ) , and " <unk> " or " <unk> " ( <unk> with a <unk> , the Philippine version of <unk> ) . In some areas , especially in <unk> , <unk> <unk> are popular . Spanish @-@ era horse @-@ drawn <unk> are still a popular tourist attraction and mode of transportation in the streets of <unk> and <unk> . All types of public road transport are privately owned and operated under government franchise . 
 The city is serviced by the <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 2 which forms the <unk> system , as distinct from the <unk> @-@ 3 which is under the <unk> system that services other parts of Metro Manila . Development of the railway system began in the 1970s under the Marcos administration , making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia . These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion @-@ dollar expansion . <unk> Line 1 runs along the length of Taft Avenue ( R @-@ 2 ) and <unk> Avenue ( R @-@ 9 ) , and the <unk> Line 2 runs along <unk> M. <unk> Avenue ( C @-@ 1 ) and Ramon <unk> Boulevard ( R @-@ 6 ) from Santa Cruz , through <unk> City , up to <unk> in <unk> . 
 The main terminal of the Philippine National Railways lies within the city . One commuter railway within Metro Manila is in operation . The line runs in a general north @-@ south direction from <unk> ( <unk> ) toward <unk> . The Port of Manila , located in the vicinity of Manila Bay is the chief seaport of the Philippines . The <unk> River Ferry Service which runs on the <unk> River is another form of transportation . The city is also served by the <unk> <unk> International Airport and Clark International Airport . 
 In 2006 , Forbes magazine ranked Manila " the world 's most <unk> city " . Manila has become notorious for its frequent traffic jams and high densities . The government has undertaken several projects to alleviate the traffic in the city . Some of the projects include : the construction of a new flyover at <unk> , the construction of the Metro Manila <unk> Stage 3 , the proposed <unk> Line 2 ( west ) extension from <unk> to <unk> or the Port Area , and the expansion of several national and local roads . However , such projects have yet to make any meaningful impact , and the traffic jams and congestion continue unabated . The urban planning of the Manila and the whole metropolis was based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan , which seeks to address the problems of Metro Manila 's urban planning and transportation . It consists of a list of short term priority projects and medium to long term infrastructure projects that will last up to <unk> .

 The Manila Health Department is responsible for the planning and implementation of the health care programs provided by the city government . It operates 59 health centers and six city @-@ run hospitals , which are free of charge . The six public city @-@ run hospitals are the <unk> <unk> <unk> Medical Center , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> Andres <unk> Memorial Medical Center , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> . <unk> Hospital , and Justice Jose <unk> Santos General Hospital . Manila is also the site of the Philippine General Hospital , the tertiary state @-@ owned hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila . 
 Manila 's healthcare is also provided by private corporations . Private hospitals that operates in the city are the Manila Doctors Hospital , Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center , Dr. José R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center , Metropolitan Medical Center , Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital , and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital . 
 The Department of Health has its main office in Manila . The national health department also operates the San <unk> Hospital , a special referral tertiary hospital . Manila is also the home to the headquarters of the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the World Health Organization Country Office for the Philippines . 
 
 = = Education = = 
 
 The center of education since the colonial period , Manila — particularly <unk> — is home to several Philippine universities and colleges as well as its oldest ones . It served as the home of the University of Santo Tomas ( 1611 ) , <unk> de San Juan de <unk> ( 1620 ) , <unk> de Manila University ( 1859 ) , Lyceum of the Philippines University and the <unk> Institute of Technology . Only <unk> de San Juan de <unk> ( 1620 ) remains at <unk> ; the University of Santo Tomas transferred to a new campus at <unk> in 1927 , and <unk> left <unk> for Loyola Heights , <unk> City ( while still retaining " de Manila " in its name ) in 1952 . 
 The University of the City of Manila ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) located at <unk> , and <unk> de Manila located just outside the walled city , are both owned and operated by the Manila city government . The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines constituent universities and the center of health sciences education in the country . The city is also the site of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population . 
 The University Belt refers to the area where there is a high concentration or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel , <unk> and <unk> districts meet . Generally , it includes the western end of <unk> Boulevard , <unk> Reyes St. ( formerly <unk> St. ) , the eastern end of <unk> M. <unk> Avenue ( formerly <unk> ) , <unk> Avenue , <unk> Street , and the different side streets . Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other . Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the <unk> River , mostly at the <unk> and <unk> districts , and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of <unk> near the border with <unk> such as the private co @-@ educational institution of De La Salle University , the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools . 
 The Division of the City Schools of Manila , a branch of the Department of Education , refers to the city 's three @-@ tier public education system . It governs the 71 public elementary schools , 32 public high schools . 
 The city also contains the Manila Science High School , the pilot science high school of the Philippines ; the National Museum , where the <unk> of Juan <unk> is housed ; the Metropolitan Museum of Manila , a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts ; the <unk> <unk> , the Children 's Museum , a place of hands @-@ on discovery and fun learning ; and , the National Library , the <unk> of the country 's printed and recorded cultural heritage and other literary and information resources .

 = <unk> ( palm ) = 
 
 <unk> is a large genus of <unk> native to Mexico , the Caribbean , Central and South America . This <unk> <unk> , non @-@ spiny genus includes both small <unk> lacking an <unk> stem and large trees . The genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny . 
 Somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 . <unk> <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species . <unk> species have a long history of human use , and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene <unk> . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 The genus <unk> has <unk> compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @-@ like or <unk> @-@ like pattern . Species are also non @-@ spiny <unk> and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and <unk> <unk> ( one which lack an <unk> stem ) . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves . 
 <unk> are large , branched and borne among the leaves . The <unk> consists of a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series of smaller branches , the <unk> . The <unk> , which bear the flowers , emerge from the <unk> . The <unk> is the main stalk , connecting the <unk> with the stem . <unk> either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . Fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orange @-@ brown or purple when mature . 
 Four different types of male flowers exist . On the basis of these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The species sometimes referred to <unk> have coiled <unk> , while the other groups have straight ones . The <unk> of those placed in <unk> are much shorter than the <unk> , while those placed in <unk> and a more narrowly defined <unk> have <unk> that are longer than the <unk> . Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus . 
 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 
 <unk> has been placed in the subfamily <unk> , the tribe <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , together with the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Within this <unk> , <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 <unk> exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera . In their 1996 Field Guide to the <unk> of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloria <unk> and <unk> <unk> combined all the species in the <unk> <unk> ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , <unk> . In his 1999 <unk> Treatment of Palm <unk> <unk> , American botanist Sidney F. <unk> divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> and John <unk> recognised a single genus in their 2005 World <unk> of <unk> , and Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus . 
 The multi @-@ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — <unk> ( in a narrow sense ) , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A. <unk> ( which <unk> placed in its own genus , <unk> ) and this has been used as an argument for the single @-@ genus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under <unk> 's five @-@ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus . In 2009 Alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the <unk> which found that some species placed in <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed in <unk> than they were to other members of that genus ( if the five @-@ genus approach was used ) , while A. <unk> , placed in <unk> by <unk> , was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk> . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 The genus <unk> was first described Carl <unk> <unk> in 1816 based on specimens collected by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé <unk> , although older , pre @-@ <unk> descriptions exist , including Charles <unk> 's 1703 description of A. <unk> . The genus was named for <unk> III <unk> , king of <unk> , known for his interest in <unk> plants . The type species is A. <unk> , a Colombian endemic . The genera <unk> and <unk> were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von <unk> in 1826 and 1837 respectively . <unk> was described by Hermann <unk> in 1857 , and <unk> by <unk> F. Cook in 1942 . 
 
 = = = Species = = = 
 
 Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus <unk> ( broadly defined ) . In 1965 , Dutch <unk> Jan Gerard <unk> Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to the <unk> of the Americas Andrew Henderson and <unk> recognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidney <unk> recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group . Largely following <unk> 's lead , <unk> <unk> and John <unk> recognised 67 species in their 2005 World <unk> of <unk> . An important element of this disagreement is the decision by <unk> to define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species , <unk> took as differences between <unk> similar species . This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in <unk> collections . The large size of the leaves , inflorescences and fruit of many <unk> species makes them difficult to collect . In addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . <unk> or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species . 
 The three recent treatments ( Henderson and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> ) recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them . The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , <unk> <unk> , other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species . <unk> doubted the validity of A. <unk> as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A. <unk> — A. <unk> , A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted both <unk> 's four species and A. <unk> . However , Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> was of the opinion that A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species . 
 Another species complex in <unk> includes A. <unk> and related species . Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A. <unk> and A. <unk> , considering the latter to either be an <unk> form of A. <unk> or a hybrid between it and A. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted A. <unk> , but <unk> considered it a dubious taxon . <unk> <unk> was recognised as a distinct species by Michael <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> and <unk> concurred , but Henderson considered it part of A. <unk> . <unk> also described a fourth member of this group , A. <unk> , and it is accepted by <unk> and <unk> . 
 
 = = Reproduction and growth = = 
 
 <unk> species are <unk> — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being insect @-@ <unk> , including A. <unk> , while <unk> in A. <unk> and A. <unk> , has been attributed both to insects and wind . 
 <unk> <unk> is remote tubular — during <unk> , as the <unk> expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . After <unk> , the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the <unk> stem . This produces a " saxophone shaped " <unk> portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot tips of <unk> seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @-@ tolerance . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Species range across the <unk> from Mexico in the north to Bolivia , Paraguay , and southern Brazil in the south . According to <unk> and <unk> , three species are found in Mexico , four in Central America , and 62 in South America . Three species are present in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and <unk> , along the southern edge of the region , and one in Haiti . 
 
 = = Habitat and ecology = = 
 
 <unk> includes both large trees and small <unk> <unk> which occupy a number of different ecological niches . <unk> stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest <unk> and in <unk> . 
 <unk> has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large <unk> species . In seasonally dry <unk> forests the density of large adult A. <unk> <unk> was correlated with canopy <unk> ; the species also dominates <unk> formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and <unk> . <unk> <unk> forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared . Similarly , stands of A. <unk> in <unk> , Brazil ( which are cultivated for <unk> fibre ) are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning , and are able to dominate burned forest patches . 
 The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by <unk> beetles . Certain species of <unk> have been mentioned as examples of " <unk> " species which are adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene <unk> . On <unk> Island , <unk> , in the Brazilian Amazon , <unk> <unk> fruit were consumed by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , deer and <unk> . <unk> , including <unk> , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . Other <unk> of <unk> fruit include <unk> <unk> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A. <unk> in the Brazilian <unk> .

David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through <unk> were based on their decision to release or <unk> the work , the New Rochelle studio was 2 @,@ 500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released , Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the <unk> , <unk> B. Bishop . The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan , the scenario writer of the company , had retired from the company . As it wound down , the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no <unk> would close with a positive bank balance . Little is known of the production of this final film , but it was directed by Emile <unk> from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan . The cameraman was Jacques <unk> .

 The five reel film was released through the <unk> Exchange as a <unk> Gold Rooster Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E. Wagner of the <unk> 's Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual <unk> ; which should prove a strong program for the <unk> program . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film 's excessive use of <unk> meetings to be highly <unk> , but found <unk> 's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances . The reviewer said that Emile <unk> had made the <unk> story more plausible . 
 Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board of <unk> required the cutting in <unk> 2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and two <unk> of gambling scenes ; and in <unk> 5 a change of the <unk> " Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " .

 Free Derry ( Irish : <unk> <unk> ) was a self @-@ declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the <unk> in January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included the <unk> and <unk> neighbourhoods , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the <unk> by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( <unk> ) . Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the <unk> from entering . After six days the residents took down the barricades and <unk> patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months . 
 Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk> . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( <unk> ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in . 
 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @-@ arm and recruit after August 1969 . In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops . The government introduced <unk> on 9 August 1971 , and in response , barricades went up once more in the <unk> and <unk> . This time , Free Derry was a no @-@ go area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the <unk> began a bombing campaign in the city centre . As before , unarmed ' <unk> ' manned the barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police . 
 Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Army 's Parachute Regiment at a march in the <unk> ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later ) . The support began to <unk> after the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the " no @-@ go " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and <unk> to occupy the area .

 Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections . Despite this , the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council , <unk> Corporation , from 1923 onwards . The <unk> maintained their majority , firstly , by manipulating the constituency boundaries ( <unk> ) so that the South Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and <unk> Ward , with unionist <unk> , returned twelve councillors between them ; <unk> , by allowing only <unk> to vote in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists , who did not own homes , were disenfranchised ; and <unk> , by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency . The result was that there were about 2 @,@ 000 nationalist families , and practically no unionists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition . The South Ward comprised the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Bishop Street and Foyle Road , and it was this area that would become Free Derry . 
 The Derry Housing Action Committee ( <unk> ) was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James <unk> Republican Club , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . It disrupted a meeting of <unk> Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the <unk> Road in the <unk> and staging a sit @-@ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the <unk> Bridge . After the meeting of <unk> Corporation was again disrupted in August , <unk> <unk> telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( <unk> ) and invited them to hold a march in Derry . The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , an <unk> committee was formed ( although in reality most of the organizing was done by <unk> and <unk> ) and the route was to take the <unk> inside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march . The Minister of Home Affairs , William Craig , made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the <unk> Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day . In the words of Martin <unk> of <unk> " this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march . " When the <unk> attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary ( <unk> ) cordon . The police drew their <unk> and struck <unk> , including <unk> MP Eddie <unk> and Westminster MP Gerry <unk> . Subsequently the police " broke ranks and used their <unk> <unk> on people in Duke Street " . <unk> trying to escape met another party of police and " these police also used their <unk> <unk> . " Water cannons were also used . The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens ' Action Committee ( <unk> ) was formed , with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice @-@ chairman .

 Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People 's Democracy , a group of students in Queen 's University Belfast . They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @-@ demonstrators at several points along the route . Finally , at <unk> Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B @-@ <unk> . The police , who were at the scene , <unk> to the B @-@ <unk> as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the <unk> , many of whom ran into the river and were <unk> with stones from the bank . Dozens of <unk> were taken to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to <unk> Bridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square , where they held a rally . <unk> broke out after the rally . Police drove <unk> into the <unk> , but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the <unk> charged into St. <unk> 's Wells and <unk> Road in the <unk> , breaking windows and beating residents . In his report on the disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that " for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @-@ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect in <unk> <unk> and inspiring hostility towards the police was <unk> great . " 
 That afternoon over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> residents built barricades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden clubs and <unk> , and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area . <unk> chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come in . Groups of men wearing <unk> patrolled the streets in shifts . John ' <unk> ' Casey , a local activist , painted " You are now entering Free Derry " in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of <unk> Road and <unk> Street . That corner , which was a popular venue for meetings , later became known as " Free Derry Corner " . On 7 January , the <unk> area was extended to include the <unk> , another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the <unk> . A clandestine radio station calling itself " Radio Free Derry " began broadcasting to residents , playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance . On a small number of occasions law @-@ <unk> attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . Despite all this , the Irish Times reported that " the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . " Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week , members of the <unk> including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them to <unk> the barricades . The barricades were taken down the following morning .

 Over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Saturday , 19 April after a planned march from <unk> Bridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in the city centre led to clashes with " <unk> " — unionists in sympathy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the <unk> were themselves driven back to their barracks . A series of pitched battles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision of <unk> Devlin , newly elected MP for Mid Ulster . Police pursuing <unk> broke into a house in William Street and severely beat the <unk> , Samuel <unk> , his family and two friends . <unk> was brought to hospital " bleeding <unk> from a number of head wounds . " At midnight four hundred <unk> men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the <unk> . <unk> of police vehicles drove through the area with <unk> <unk> . 
 The following day , several thousand residents , led by the <unk> , withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out . With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the <unk> 's Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . The barricades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented . 
 Samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual <unk> Boys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance . 
 
 = = August – October 1969 = = 
 
 The <unk> Boys ' parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city 's gates against the army of King James . At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year . Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the <unk> , and were often openly hostile to the residents . On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association ( <unk> ) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade , and to defend the <unk> and <unk> in the event of an attack . The chairman was <unk> <unk> , an Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) veteran ; the vice @-@ chairman was Paddy Doherty , a popular local man sometimes known as " Paddy <unk> " and the secretary was <unk> White , another leading republican and leader of the James <unk> Republican Club . Street committees were formed under the overall command of the <unk> and barricades were built on the night of 11 August . The parade took place as planned on 12 August . As it passed through Waterloo Place , on the edge of the <unk> , hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade . Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours , then the police joined in . They charged up William Street against the <unk> , followed by the ' <unk> ' . They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs . The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the <unk> . Late in the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police fired <unk> of <unk> gas into the crowd . <unk> on the roof of a high @-@ rise block of flats on <unk> Street threw petrol bombs down on the police . <unk> @-@ <unk> were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and <unk> headquarters in Paddy Doherty 's house in Westland Street , and first aid stations were operating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . Women and girls made milk @-@ bottle <unk> of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and " Radio Free Derry " broadcast to the fighters and their families . On the third day of fighting , 14 August , the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary ( B @-@ <unk> ) , a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere . Before they engaged , however , British troops were deployed at the scene , carrying automatic rifles and sub @-@ machine guns . The <unk> and B @-@ <unk> withdrew , and the troops took up positions outside the <unk> area . 
 A <unk> that included <unk> <unk> met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met , including the <unk> of the <unk> , the disbandment of the B @-@ <unk> and the abolition of <unk> ( the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland ) . The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the <unk> and <unk> districts . A ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order . When the British Home Secretary , Jim <unk> , visited Northern Ireland and announced his intention to visit the <unk> on 28 August , he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him . <unk> agreed . <unk> by members of the Defence Committee , he was " swept along by a <unk> crowd of thousands " up <unk> Street and into <unk> Road , where he " took refuge " in a local house , and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window . In preparation for <unk> 's visit the " Free Derry " wall was painted white and the " You are now entering Free Derry " sign was professionally re @-@ painted in black <unk> . 
 Following <unk> 's visit , some barricades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades . There was very little crime . <unk> , in the words of <unk> <unk> , " as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from <unk> <unk> on the need for solidarity within the area . " In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road . 
 The Hunt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland was presented to the <unk> cabinet in early October . Jim <unk> held talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October , following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public . They included the recommendation that the <unk> should be ' ordinarily ' unarmed , and that the B @-@ <unk> should be phased out and replaced by a new force . The new <unk> Chief Constable , Arthur Young , an <unk> , was announced , and travelled to Belfast with <unk> . The same day , <unk> <unk> announced that the <unk> was to be dissolved . On 11 October <unk> and Young visited Free Derry , and on 12 October the first military police entered the <unk> , on foot and unarmed .

 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962 . It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> and Paddy Doherty in August 1969 that he " couldn 't defend the <unk> . I haven 't the men nor the guns to do it . " During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left . Its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the Irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism , both British and Irish . Republican <unk> were formed in Northern Ireland , where <unk> <unk> was proscribed . These clubs were involved in the formation of <unk> in 1967 . In Derry , the James <unk> Republican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals , with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and Derry <unk> Action Committee . The Derry Citizens ' Defence Association was formed initially by <unk> , who then invited other nationalists to join . Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like <unk> White and the older , traditional <unk> such as <unk> <unk> , both sides saw the unrest of 1968 @-@ 69 as a chance to advance republican aims , and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969 . 
 The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the <unk> , and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both . When <unk> were arrested after the Official 's Easter parade in March 1970 , Officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McGuinness , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the <unk> . 
 Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 . In September , after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man , William King , the British Army erected a ' peace ring ' to <unk> the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled . Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets . Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people . <unk> between youths and troops became more frequent . The riot following the Officials ' Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used ' <unk> squads ' , who rushed into the <unk> wielding <unk> to make arrests . The <unk> squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations . There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance . The <unk> were condemned as <unk> by <unk> , who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation . The Labour radicals and Official <unk> , still working together , tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the Young <unk> Association — but to no <unk> . The <unk> , while <unk> of riots , viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation . This philosophy was more attractive to <unk> , and some of them joined the Provisional IRA . The deaths of two leading <unk> in a premature explosion in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization . Nevertheless , up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numerically small . 
 Two men , <unk> <unk> and Desmond Beattie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 . They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party ( <unk> ) , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from <unk> in protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . The result was a surge of support for the IRA . The <unk> held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , people <unk> up to join , and there was large @-@ scale rioting . The British Army post at <unk> 's Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA . 
 
 = = <unk> and the third Free Derry = = 
 
 The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that <unk> without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of <unk> and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including <unk> <unk> and <unk> White were interned . In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate . 
 Gun attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after <unk> , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August to <unk> the barricades . A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , <unk> <unk> , was killed . A crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt . 
 The Derry <unk> had little contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly for sniping . At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . <unk> <unk> wrote that " the Derry <unk> , under Martin McGuinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . " 
 Although both <unk> operated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry . The barricades were manned by unarmed ' <unk> ' . Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O <unk> , a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International .

 An anti @-@ <unk> protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( <unk> ) at <unk> Camp in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment ( 1 <unk> ) . <unk> had organised a march from the <unk> to Derry city centre , in defiance of a ban , on the following Sunday , 30 January 1972 . Both <unk> were asked , and agreed , to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully . The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to prevent <unk> from reaching the city centre . On the day , march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to Free Derry Corner , but some youths proceeded to the barrier at William Street and <unk> soldiers . Troops from 1 <unk> then moved into Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed . A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in June 1972 . Like the killing of <unk> and Beattie the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been ' <unk> ' . 
 
 = = February - July 1972 = = 
 
 Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA . Best was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the <unk> . He was abducted , interrogated and shot . The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . Martin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of senior <unk> who travelled to London for talks with William <unk> , the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the <unk> estate . 
 Political pressure for the action against the " no @-@ go " areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision not to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operation <unk> was launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured <unk> ( AVREs ) , dismantled the barricades and occupied the area . 
 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 
 After Operation <unk> , the British Army controlled the <unk> and <unk> by <unk> large numbers of troops within the area , by conducting large @-@ scale ' search ' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — remained <unk> opposed to the army and to the state . 
 Many of the residents ' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which <unk> the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single <unk> vote . <unk> were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 . Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped , with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of the <unk> Artists and the Museum of Free Derry .

 In September 2005 , lead singer Corey Taylor announced that Stone <unk> would return with a second album . He said that they had written over 30 songs , some during the writing process of Vol . 3 : ( The <unk> <unk> ) , the third album by vocalist Taylor and guitarist James Root 's other band <unk> , and that they were working on <unk> the tracks before entering the studio . Dave <unk> was originally slated to produce the album , however , on January 22 , 2006 Stone <unk> began working on the album with producer Nick <unk> at Dave Grohl 's personal studio ( Studio <unk> ) , in Los Angeles . Time in the studio began with a week of pre @-@ production , during which guitarist Josh Rand says producer <unk> " pushed [ the band ] to the brink and back " to help fine @-@ tune the songs they had previously written . Though Rand and Taylor wrote most of the music and lyrics for the first album , respectively , writing for Come What ( ever ) May was done by all members . 
 Following this , the band set out to record 18 tracks and work began on recording Joel <unk> 's drum tracks . However , <unk> was forced to leave the studio after four weeks due to his young son 's diagnosis of a <unk> <unk> . With the fate of the album in jeopardy , Stone <unk> recruited ex @-@ <unk> member Roy <unk> as a session drummer . <unk> recorded drums for all but two tracks on the album , Godsmack drummer Shannon <unk> performed on the track " 30 / 30 @-@ 150 " and guitarist Root performed drums on the bonus track " The Day I Let Go . " In an interview with Revolver during the recording process vocalist Taylor talked about the differences between this album and their previous album , Stone <unk> . He said that pressures from fans and the record label were much larger ; also noting that he " <unk> on the pressure , because it gets [ him ] going . " While promising that " the album 's gonna be miles above the first one , " Taylor explained that it is " more melodic and darker " . In late March 2006 , drummer Joel <unk> officially left Stone <unk> and the band was talking with a few drummers who could replace him . On April 7 , 2006 the recording sessions for Come What ( ever ) May concluded . A month later session drummer Roy <unk> joined Stone <unk> on a full @-@ time basis .

It borders Libya to the south , <unk> to the east , Sudan to the west , and the Central African Republic to the north . Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960 , when it declared independence . Some four years later , the former French colony made its <unk> at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan . For the next three decades , Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese @-@ backed rebels ; the civil war ended in 1990 , although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008 . During Chad 's greatest era of instability , athletes from the country did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in <unk> , Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , USSR , although <unk> were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008 .

 View of the World from 9th Avenue ( sometimes A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World , A New Yorker 's View of the World or simply View of the World ) is a 1976 illustration by Saul <unk> that served as the cover of the March 29 , 1976 , edition of The New Yorker . The work presents the view from Manhattan of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world . 
 View of the World has been parodied by Ted <unk> , Columbia Pictures , The New Yorker , The Economist and Mad Magazine , among others . The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways . The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in <unk> v. Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc. in favor of <unk> because of copyright violations by Columbia Pictures . The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world .

 Saul <unk> created 85 covers and <unk> internal drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker , including its March 29 , 1976 cover , titled " View of the World from 9th Avenue " . This is regarded as his most famous work . It is considered an example of unintentional fame : <unk> has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The work is sometimes referred to as A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World or A New Yorker 's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @-@ absorbed New Yorkers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States <unk> Office for the work . It assigned the copyright to <unk> and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The illustration is split in two parts , with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan 's 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River ( appropriately labeled ) , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a westward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a <unk> bounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing " Jersey " , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ; Washington , D.C. ; Las Vegas ; Kansas City ; and Chicago ) and three states ( Texas , Utah , and Nebraska ) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey , which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico . The Pacific Ocean , slightly wider than the Hudson , separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China , Japan and Russia . Notably , the image depicts the world with a back turned to Europe , which is absent from the painting . 
 The work is composed in ink , pencil , colored pencil , and <unk> on paper and measures 28 by 19 inches ( 71 cm × 48 cm ) . When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches , the University of Pennsylvania summarized the work as a " bird 's @-@ eye view of the city from <unk> Avenue in a straight line westward , with space becoming ever more <unk> ... " They also described the work as a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek view of the world . New York interpreted the New York @-@ centric mind 's view of the rest of the world as a set of outer <unk> as iconic . National Post journalist Robert <unk> described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan .

 View of the World has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways . The work has been imitated in <unk> format by numerous municipalities , states and nations . <unk> had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting , had they been paid , a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use . <unk> , writing in The National Post , noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was " understood and borrowed " by the whole world . Local artists , especially poster artists , presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions . <unk> demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global <unk> from which the students viewed the world . 
 The illustration — <unk> depicting New Yorkers ' self @-@ image of their place in the world , or perhaps outsiders ' view of New Yorkers ' self @-@ image — inspired many similar works , including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit , <unk> v. Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc . , <unk> F. <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> 1987 ) , which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright <unk> held on his work . 
 On June 5 , 2003 , during the first term of George W. Bush 's presidency , Ted <unk> presented A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue as a <unk> of View of the World from 9th Avenue in a Universal Press Syndicate editorial cartoon . He replaced the letters representing The New Yorker with The <unk> . 
 The cover was later <unk> by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6 , 2008 . The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska , with Russia in the far background . 
 The March 21 , 2009 The Economist included a story entitled " How China sees the World " that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image , but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing 's Chang 'an Avenue instead of Manhattan . A caption above the illustration reads " <unk> by Jon Berkeley ( with <unk> to <unk> and The New Yorker ) " . It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis . 
 The October 1 , 2012 cover of Mad Magazine <unk> the problems with the September release of Apple Inc . ' s iOS 6 mobile operating system which included Apple Maps , a replacement for Google Maps .

 During the 16th century , <unk> was named " River de <unk> " by Portuguese <unk> . There are several legends surrounding the name <unk> . During the Brooke dynasty , the indigenous <unk> people practised <unk> to maintain their social status in the community . They threw the heads into the <unk> River , after which the heads had to be collected from the river . The practice of collecting the heads was known as " <unk> <unk> " ( picking heads ) in the local native language . Another story relates that two <unk> warriors named <unk> and <unk> built houses along the river . They and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from <unk> River because the river bank was flat and wide . Therefore , the small river stream was named " <unk> <unk> " river . <unk> who came to <unk> subsequently pronounced the name as " <unk> " , and later the name evolved into " <unk> " and , finally , " <unk> " .

He went to <unk> before coming back to <unk> . He dropped off at <unk> River on 13 August 1867 . His observations of the village were recorded as follows : 
 The fort of <unk> which was built entirely of wood , was in somewhat ruinous condition . It stood nearly on the sea @-@ shore , and just behind it , at a distance of few paces , the <unk> forests commenced ... Some <unk> had settled at the vicinity of the fort and had built a small <unk> ; but the village is chiefly formed by the houses of the <unk> beyond the Chinese <unk> ( village ) . These <unk> used to live further up the river , but since the construction of the fort , and the installation of an officer of the <unk> near the mouth of the river , they came to settle near the sea – a thing they would never have <unk> to do in former days for fear of the attacks of the <unk> pirates and <unk> pirates . 
 The houses of the <unk> people were built in rows on both sides of the <unk> River , mostly furnished by <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river , which was used for the processing of <unk> <unk> . On 8 September 1867 , the first <unk> General Council meeting ( now <unk> State Legislative Assembly ) took place here . It was made up of 21 elected local community members ( five British officers and 16 Malay and <unk> local chiefs ) .

 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) believed Croatia would use the Croatian Territorial Defence Force 's ( <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) equipment to build its own army and confront the <unk> itself . In order to minimize the expected resistance , the <unk> confiscated the <unk> weapons . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs . 
 In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . In an effort to bolster its defence , Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions , adopting military organisation . In addition there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police . The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons needed to arm many of the troops . 
 Preparations to set up the Croatian National Guard ( <unk> <unk> garde – <unk> ) began on 12 April 1991 . Establishment of the <unk> as a police force with military capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in <unk> and at <unk> Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the <unk> . The <unk> , formally established on 23 April , was tasked with protection of the constitutional order , maintenance of public order , anti @-@ terrorist operations , protection of Croatia 's borders , territory , coast and territorial waters , as well as the protection of high @-@ value structures and high @-@ profile persons .

 On 18 May 1991 , the <unk> Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the <unk> . The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the <unk> Special Police Unit ( <unk> ) . Initially , it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . The most senior among the former <unk> was Ante <unk> , previously a <unk> @-@ <unk> ( non @-@ commissioned officer – <unk> ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , <unk> was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander . Major <unk> <unk> , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assigned the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in the village of <unk> in the region of <unk> <unk> , on the grounds of the former " Josip <unk> Tito " political school . The site , adjacent to the border of Slovenia , was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of <unk> or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the <unk> <unk> was transferred to <unk> Peak north of Zagreb leaving <unk> base to the <unk> Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the <unk> Battalion . 
 The <unk> Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June . It was stationed in Vukovar , tasked with preparation of city defences and organisation of volunteer troops . In August , <unk> took over command of the battalion from <unk> . The same month , the <unk> Battalion was deployed to the <unk> , where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces out of the town of <unk> <unk> . In September , the battalion was deployed to <unk> , where it took part in battle to control <unk> against the <unk> . Troops assigned to the battalion captured <unk> barracks in <unk> . During combat in <unk> , 30 troops of the <unk> Battalion , assisted by <unk> <unk> , captured <unk> Major General <unk> <unk> , along with three armoured personnel carriers ( <unk> ) and 32 soldiers . The unit was deployed to <unk> on 28 October , tasked with <unk> <unk> from the <unk> . After the deployment to <unk> , a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there , while the remainder of the unit returned to <unk> . The <unk> was renamed the Croatian Army ( <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) on 3 November 1991 . In late 1991 , personnel of the <unk> Battalion set up another special forces unit of the <unk> — the <unk> <unk> Battalion based in <unk> . 
 In 1992 , elements of the <unk> Battalion took part in the Battle of <unk> , before setting up a training camp in the town of <unk> . There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) . Later that year , elements of the battalion took part in Operation Tiger — aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik . In 1993 , elements of the <unk> Battalion took part in Operation <unk> , fighting in the area of <unk> . The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the <unk> Battalion as one of the best units of the <unk> .

 = Temple Beth Israel ( Eugene , Oregon ) = 
 
 Temple Beth Israel ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ) is a <unk> synagogue located at 1175 East 29th Avenue in Eugene , Oregon . Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street . It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its current <unk> @-@ <unk> facilities in 2008 . 
 In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox Congregation <unk> Torah . Beth Israel came under attack from neo @-@ Nazi members of the <unk> twice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In both cases the <unk> were caught and convicted . 
 Services were lay @-@ led for decades . Marcus Simmons was hired as the congregation 's first rabbi in 1959 , but left in 1961 . After a gap of two years , Louis <unk> became rabbi in 1963 , and served until his death in 1976 . He was followed by <unk> <unk> , who served from 1977 to 1994 , and <unk> in turn was succeeded by <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> . Maurice Harris joined <unk> @-@ <unk> as associate rabbi in 2003 , and served until 2011 , when he was succeeded by Boris <unk> . As of 2014 , led by <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> , Beth Israel had approximately 400 member households , and was the largest synagogue in Eugene .

 Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century , but most moved on . In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by the 1920s Eugene 's Jewish community began gathering prayer <unk> for holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that " [ a ] <unk> <unk> <unk> 's death in 1933 , his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 In 1952 , the congregation constructed a one @-@ story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) property at <unk> Portland Street . Designed by architect and Holocaust @-@ survivor Heinrich <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes " by <unk> . 
 Temple Beth Israel 's services and religious functions were lay @-@ led for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons . Originally from England , he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University , and was ordained at the Hebrew <unk> <unk> . He emigrated to the United States in 1957 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however , agreed that a full @-@ time rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted a <unk> position in <unk> , California . 
 Following a hiatus of two years , Louis <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1963 . Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York . He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal , and from 1959 to 1963 was the first <unk> rabbi at Syracuse University . There was some concern about <unk> 's hiring , as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) . He served until his death in 1976 .

 <unk> <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1977 . <unk> in Reform Judaism , he had previously served as a rabbi in <unk> , Kansas for two years , then lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene . <unk> was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights , anti @-@ nuclear and anti @-@ war activism , support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non @-@ <unk> members of Eugene 's Jewish community . 
 <unk> attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " <unk> <unk> " in his approach to <unk> . He was willing to <unk> at an <unk> if the non @-@ Jewish partner , after discussions with the rabbi , agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , and raising future children as Jews " . The non @-@ Jewish partner making this commitment became a " <unk> <unk> " , or " non @-@ Jewish member of the Jewish people " . 
 <unk> 's wife Alice was a strong feminist , and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the <unk> and ritual . These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example , using gender @-@ neutral terms and <unk> for God , and adding references to the Biblical <unk> in prayers like the <unk> , which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical <unk> . While most congregation members approved of these changes , a minority resisted them .

 By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues , including personal <unk> , the rabbi 's activism and " advocacy of ' ultra @-@ liberal ' causes " , political differences over the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , and 
 a myriad of additional Jewish cultural / religious issues , such as the acceptance of <unk> couples , adherence to <unk> dietary laws , the use of modern language and music during worship services , <unk> of certain prayers such as the <unk> to make them less <unk> , and so on . 
 However , the biggest source of division , which <unk> all others , was " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . " 
 In the early 1990s a group of newly <unk> members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue , complete with a <unk> , a partition separating men and women . The " more feminist @-@ minded " members strongly objected to having a <unk> anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the <unk> would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . <unk> also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called " The <unk> <unk> " , and in 1998 renamed " Congregation <unk> Torah " . 
 <unk> held himself responsible , and the schism led to his " <unk> of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi " . As a result , he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families . <unk> died two years later at age 51 .

 The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had no affiliation . In late 1996 , after considering both Reform and <unk> as <unk> , the congregation affiliated with the <unk> movement . By 1999 , membership had grown to around 370 families . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> was instrumental in developing the concept of " <unk> <unk> " , the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way .

 Originally sized for 75 families , Temple Beth Israel 's Portland Street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7 @,@ 500 square feet ( 700 m2 ) to accommodate 250 families and 150 students . Despite these additions and the loss of members to Congregation <unk> Torah , the synagogue was not large enough , particularly during the High <unk> , when extra space had to be rented . In 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the University Street Christian Church for $ 500 @,@ 000 ( today $ 740 @,@ 000 ) , and began planning for a new facility .

 New York State Route 93 ( NY 93 ) is a 43 @.@ 08 @-@ mile ( 69 @.@ 33 km ) state highway in western New York in the United States . The route begins at an intersection with NY <unk> in the village of <unk> and runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east end at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Newstead , just south of the village of <unk> . NY 93 serves as a connector between several major <unk> , including NY 104 in <unk> , NY 31 just west of the city of <unk> , and NY 78 south of the city . 
 The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Although it began in <unk> and ended in Newstead as it does today , the initial routing of NY 93 <unk> from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of <unk> . From <unk> to <unk> 's eastern suburbs , the highway originally used NY 425 , Lower Mountain Road , <unk> Road , and a series of streets in <unk> . NY 93 was moved onto NY 104 and Junction Road in <unk> in the 1940s , and altered to bypass <unk> to the south on a new highway and Robinson and <unk> roads in 1991 . In 2006 , NY 93 was realigned west of <unk> to continue south on Junction Road to NY 31 . The change removed NY 93 from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ owned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s .

 NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY <unk> ( Main Street ; co @-@ designated but not signed as County Route 907 or CR 907 ) in the center of the village of <unk> . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named <unk> Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before <unk> to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of <unk> . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly <unk> to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway <unk> to a two @-@ lane road and changes names to <unk> – <unk> Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Creek Road ) . 
 After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with <unk> – Wilson Road ( CR 36 ) on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town . The route continues on a southeast track through Porter , passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road ( CR 57 ) . Another southeastward stretch brings the route across <unk> Creek and into the hamlet of <unk> , where NY 93 becomes the community 's main street . Through <unk> , NY 93 retains the <unk> – <unk> Road name , intersecting with <unk> Road ( CR 17 ) in the hamlet 's business district . 
 Just outside <unk> , NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road ( CR 83 ) and Church Street ( CR 56 ) on its way to the town of <unk> . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route 's intersection with NY 425 ( <unk> – Wilson Road ) . The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of <unk> Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road . It immediately intersects with Stone Road ( CR 19 ) before leaving the hamlet .

 Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the <unk> – <unk> town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of <unk> Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR <unk> ) . <unk> to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of <unk> . From here , the route crosses over <unk> Transportation 's <unk> <unk> rail line at the hamlet of <unk> Junction before intersecting with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) and NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 . 
 Now fully in the town of <unk> , NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of <unk> , where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the <unk> Bypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with <unk> Road ( CR 903 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a more <unk> course through an undeveloped part of the town of <unk> to a junction with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the <unk> – <unk> town line . The <unk> Bypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road . 
 The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , the <unk> – <unk> town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town of <unk> as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Road at an intersection with Beattie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of <unk> , where it meets <unk> Road ( CR 35 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 142 ) at adjacent intersections just east of the town line .

 NY 93 takes over <unk> Road 's name and right @-@ of @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of <unk> . Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of <unk> , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of <unk> , connecting to Block Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it approaches <unk> Creek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with <unk> Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 across <unk> Creek and into the Erie County town of Newstead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( <unk> Road ) . 
 Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 ( <unk> Creek Road ) on its way to the hamlet of <unk> Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . South of <unk> Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( <unk> Road ) and CR 42 ( Rapids Road ) . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( <unk> Corner – <unk> Road ) to the outskirts of the village of <unk> , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village . 
 The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown <unk> . Here , NY 93 intersects with CR <unk> ( John Street ) at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of <unk> 's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with <unk> Street . The highway takes on the <unk> Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown <unk> . Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Street at an intersection with Jackson Street . 
 As the route continues southward through the southern part of <unk> , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's intersection with CR 163 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( <unk> Drive ) . NY 93 exits <unk> a short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the <unk> Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a <unk> intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where <unk> Street and NY 93 both come to an end .

 NY 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , connecting the cities and villages of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . While the <unk> of NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time . When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned south at the hamlet of North Ridge and overlapped with NY 425 along <unk> – Wilson Road to Lower Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 . NY 425 went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following NY 3 along Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , Upper Mountain , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of <unk> . At <unk> Street , NY 93 left NY 3 and exited the city along <unk> , High , and <unk> streets and <unk> Road . It met its current alignment southeast of the city in <unk> . 
 NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road between <unk> Road ( NY 425 ) and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along <unk> , Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY <unk> even though all of NY 3 's former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY <unk> designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road . 
 Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) .

 The <unk> Bypass , a highway bypassing downtown <unk> to the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 133 ) to <unk> Road in <unk> . The portion of <unk> Road ( NY 93 's former routing ) east of the <unk> city limits became NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 <unk> and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and <unk> Road became state @-@ maintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of <unk> Road to Niagara County . <unk> Road is now CR 142 . 
 On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and <unk> it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The <unk> for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed . <unk> obliged to the request in 2006 , <unk> NY 93 as proposed and <unk> NY 270 southward to NY 31 .

The organization flew " the first international relief <unk> to Cambodia since 1975 " , delivering medicine to Phnom @-@ Penh . Operation California had <unk> more than $ 3 million worth of aid by October 1979 . 
 Since then , Operation USA has become a highly acclaimed aid organization that is involved in helping people in different ways around the world . In 1982 , Operation California sent " the first private <unk> from the U.S. to Poland " , delivering 200 @,@ 000 <unk> of medical supplies and medicine ; that year Operation California also <unk> medical supplies to Lebanon .

In 1986 Operation California , in conjunction with Medical Aid to El Salvador , sent " [ t ] <unk> cargo planes carrying $ 500 @,@ 000 worth of relief supplies to earthquake @-@ stricken El Salvador " . 
 In 1988 , Operation California began using the name Operation USA because it better described the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people . In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had <unk> <unk> by a Los Angeles @-@ based plastic surgeon , Dr Stanley <unk> . Medical aid effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990 , by <unk> in conjunction with USSR relief workers . In 1991 <unk> delivered aid to Bangladesh . <unk> delivered aid to war torn Somali 's in 1993 .

 = Typhoon <unk> ( 2013 ) = 
 
 Typhoon <unk> , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Philippines in late October 2013 . Forming on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . <unk> developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on November 2 off the southeast coast of China . Typhoon <unk> stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions , resulting in quick weakening . By November 3 , it had weakened to tropical storm status , and was no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon , <unk> damaged 32 @,@ 000 houses , including 3 @,@ 000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . High winds and rainfall left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . 
 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 
 On October 27 , an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of Guam , and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and <unk> outflow . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km ( 235 mi ) to the southeast of <unk> , Guam . At 2100 UTC on October 28 , the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing advisories on the depression , giving it the local name <unk> . The next day , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . By that time , the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north . With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea , <unk> wind shear , and improving outflow , <unk> gradually strengthened , and the JTWC also upgraded <unk> to tropical storm status on October 30 after an eye feature developed . 
 While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , <unk> quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well @-@ defined eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit . On October 31 , <unk> made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan , and developed a <unk> eyewall while initially moving over land . Land interaction weakened the eye by the time <unk> emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31 . The next day , PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region . <unk> rebuilt around the center , with continued favorable conditions allowing for <unk> . 
 Late on November 1 , a large eye redeveloped , and the JTWC estimated <unk> attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Early the next day , the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Later , increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate , and <unk> began slowing about 260 km ( 160 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge . After remaining nearly stationary , <unk> began moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest due to a new ridge . The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from <unk> , and <unk> deteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3 . The next day , the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection . Also on November 4 , the JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast . The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5 .

 Before <unk> struck the Philippines , PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides . High winds knocked down trees across Luzon , and left about 80 % of Cagayan province without power , as well as some areas without internet or <unk> service . <unk> of the Pan @-@ Philippine Highway were blocked , and in Lal @-@ Lo , Cagayan , a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages . Agriculture damage was estimated at <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 3 million USD ) , occurring just before the start of the harvest . Across the island , the typhoon damaged 32 @,@ <unk> houses , including 3 @,@ <unk> that were destroyed , forcing 65 @,@ 648 people to evacuate to storm shelters . Overall , <unk> killed four people in the Philippines , and left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . After the storm , workers quickly restored power lines , while the government provided monetary assistance to storm @-@ ravaged families , after Cagayan was declared a state of <unk> . Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm . 
 The China National Meteorological Centre issued a " yellow alert " , the second @-@ lowest of the four level warning system , for <unk> due to the threat of the storm . The agency recommended boats to return to port . <unk> in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression <unk> , and released water from three dams to prevent overflow .

 <unk> 's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game , a spin @-@ off from the <unk> series for the Game Boy portable console . It is a <unk> clone ; the player controls <unk> along the screen 's edge to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The game 's 55 levels include power @-@ ups , bonus rounds , and minigames . <unk> 's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R & D1 . The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match <unk> 's signature characteristics . <unk> 's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995 , later in Europe , and last in North America in 1996 . 
 Reviewers considered the game an improvement on the <unk> formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the <unk> series . It was included in multiple top Game Boy game lists and was later <unk> on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> . 
 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 The player controls <unk> along the screen 's edges to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The player loses a life if <unk> hits the edge of the screen . Each of the game 's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for <unk> to clear . The ten different block types vary in <unk> and points value . A well @-@ timed hit of the <unk> gives <unk> a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks . Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time . The player can find <unk> stars that lead to minigames , such as air hockey , where the player can earn extra lives . The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid . Some enemies contain bonus items . Each stage ends in a boss fight . 
 With stone , needle , flame , and spark power @-@ ups , <unk> can transform to interact with blocks differently . For instance , the spark power @-@ up lets <unk> break through otherwise <unk> blocks , and the needle lets <unk> hit spikes once without losing a life . The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in @-@ game when played with the Super Game Boy .

 The game was developed by HAL Laboratory with <unk> Yokoi 's Nintendo R & D1 , and published by Nintendo . At one point in development , HAL decided that the game did not feel like a <unk> game . The team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how <unk> should move . <unk> games contain elements of unrestricted , creative movement as a general theme . <unk> 's Block Ball was released for the Game Boy first in Japan in 1995 and later in Europe ( 1995 ) and North America ( May 1996 ) . It was later <unk> on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> , and released first in Japan ( October 2011 ) and later in Europe ( February 2012 ) and North America ( May 2012 ) .

 On release , the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded <unk> 's Block Ball for <unk> the <unk> formula to create a new and enjoyable game . They especially praised the unique power @-@ ups , though <unk> Boyer and <unk> X also felt the game was too short and easy . Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages , but wondered how its eight <unk> of memory were being used . The magazine found the parts where <unk> eats the <unk> blocks to be innovative . All six of the magazine 's reviewers recommended the game . 
 IGN wrote that the game was primarily remembered as " an <unk> or <unk> clone skinned with the <unk> franchise " . IGN calculated an average reviewer score of 7 @.@ 4 / 10 . The <unk> series became known for its number of non @-@ platformer spin @-@ offs , of which Block Ball was one , like <unk> 's <unk> Land and <unk> 's Dream Course . <unk> 's spherical shape lent itself towards ball @-@ like roles . IGN wrote that Block Ball was the first " truly out there " <unk> spin @-@ off , but that the game was too short . 
 Planet Game Boy called it one of the original Game Boy 's ten " all @-@ time classics " and GamesRadar placed it among the top 25 Game Boy games released . They considered <unk> 's Block Ball an improvement upon <unk> , a Game Boy launch title and <unk> clone . IGN recommended the game upon its 3DS <unk> both in general and for <unk> fans . Nintendo World Report recommended the game to players who like score attack games and called it the best version of <unk> released . <unk> reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behind the gameplay and <unk> themes . Alternatively , <unk> 's Block Ball received the lowest rating on Tim Rogers 's 2004 " <unk> <unk> System for Portable Games " ( a metric by which he played a game while counting stops on the circular <unk> train line until he lost interest ) with a score of " one " stop . He called it " too <unk> bland " . 
 In a retrospective review , <unk> had high praise for the level design , graphics , and animations . They also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most <unk> <unk> . The magazine also liked how the game fit the <unk> universe , apart from its increased difficulty — <unk> occasionally had trouble hitting the slow @-@ paced ball with precision .

 = Commonwealth War Graves Commission = 
 
 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission ( <unk> ) is an <unk> organisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark , record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members who died in the two World Wars . The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . The Commission was founded by <unk> Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission . The change to the present name took place in 1960 . 
 The Commission , as part of its mandate , is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally . To this end , the war dead are commemorated by name on a <unk> , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally , irrespective of military or civil rank , race or <unk> . 
 The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries . Since its inception , the Commission has constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> and numerous memorials . The Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . The Commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states : United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India and South Africa . The current President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is Prince Edward , Duke of Kent .

 On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , <unk> Ware , a director of the Rio <unk> Company , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio <unk> chairman , Viscount <unk> , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves <unk> Commission . The new Graves <unk> Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . 
 When municipal <unk> began to <unk> Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further <unk> . Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French <unk> under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in <unk> , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . 
 As reports of the grave registration work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17 @,@ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests . The Graves <unk> Commission became the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <unk> from relatives of those killed . The <unk> 's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia . 
 
 = = = Formal establishment = = = 
 
 As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ war period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president . The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> after the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate to <unk> the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice @-@ chairman . The Commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War . Once land for <unk> and memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some <unk> @,@ 000 graves had been identified and a further <unk> @,@ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave . 
 The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . However , the war required <unk> of a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military . A committee under <unk> Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the <unk> . Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of <unk> that had developed between serving ranks . 
 An article in The Times on 17 February 1919 by <unk> Kipling carried the Commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like . The article entitled War Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling 's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The illustrated booklet was intended to <unk> the impact of Kenyon 's report as it included illustrations of <unk> with mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos . There was an immediate public <unk> following the publication of the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to not <unk> the bodies of the dead . The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920 . Sir James <unk> started the debate , followed by speeches by William <unk> @-@ <unk> in favour of the Commission 's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those <unk> repatriation and opposing <unk> of grave markers . Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote . <unk> withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles . 
 
 = = = First <unk> and memorials to the missing = = = 
 
 Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Baker , Sir Reginald <unk> , and Sir Edwin <unk> were commissioned to design the <unk> and memorials . <unk> Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions . 
 In 1920 , the Commission built three experimental <unk> at Le <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report . Of these , the <unk> Communal Cemetery and <unk> was agreed to be the most successful . Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform <unk> in a garden setting , augmented by <unk> 's Cross of <unk> and <unk> ' Stone of Remembrance . After some adjustments , <unk> became the template for the Commission 's building programme . <unk> were required because all three experimental <unk> went over budget . To ensure future <unk> remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in <unk> that contained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent £ 7 @,@ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1920 as construction of <unk> and memorials increased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @,@ 000 <unk> which were ready for <unk> <unk> , and burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @,@ 000 <unk> a week to France . In many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 <unk> had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 <unk> , a thousand Crosses of <unk> , and 400 Stones of Remembrance . 
 The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315 @,@ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for the <unk> of memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing <unk> rather than as separate structures . 
 Reginald <unk> 's <unk> Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed , and was unveiled on 24 July 1927 . The <unk> Gate ( <unk> ) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 @,@ <unk> names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker 's <unk> <unk> Memorial to the Missing . Other memorials followed : the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James <unk> ; the <unk> Memorial on the Somme and the <unk> Memorial designed by Edwin <unk> ; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward <unk> Warren . The <unk> and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing : the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial for the forces of India , the <unk> Memorial by Canada , the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial by Australia , the <unk> Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the <unk> Memorial in 1932 , though the <unk> Memorial would not be finished until 1936 , the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial until 1938 and <unk> were still conducting work on the <unk> Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 . 
 The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> Institute at <unk> , Egypt — complete with library , and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed with local political pressure . 
 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 
 From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as <unk> . When the war began turning in favour of the Allies , the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World War <unk> and memorials . It also began the task of commemorating the 600 @,@ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completed <unk> Canadian War Cemetery , the first of <unk> new <unk> and 36 new memorials . Eventually , over 350 @,@ 000 new <unk> were erected . Many were made from <unk> Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme . The <unk> neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . These , together with the <unk> of maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s . 
 With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware 's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission 's charter on 7 February 1941 , <unk> the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 @,@ 000 civilians . The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958 .

 Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' Imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960 . 
 More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for <unk> in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether . <unk> Indian Cemetery in Germany was <unk> after the end of World War II and until the German <unk> because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The Six @-@ Day War and War of <unk> resulted in the destruction of Port <unk> Memorial and Aden Memorial , and the death of a Commission <unk> at Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War two <unk> in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War . 
 The Commission has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission 's assistance to design and construct <unk> in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the <unk> War . Although these <unk> are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission <unk> , the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these <unk> . Since 2005 , the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for <unk> and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility . As of 2011 , the Commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada . 
 In 2008 , an <unk> excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of <unk> Wood outside of <unk> . Two @-@ hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <unk> ( <unk> Wood ) Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the last such <unk> having been built after the Second World War . 
 
 = = <unk> sites and memorials = = 
 
 The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 @,@ 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a <unk> , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . The vast majority of burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal <unk> and parish <unk> located in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> worldwide . The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is the <unk> Memorial . 
 
 = = = <unk> for inclusion = = = 
 
 The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war , while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after <unk> Day as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice . 
 <unk> who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . 
 
 = = = Architects and <unk> = = = 
 
 As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium ( Baker , <unk> and <unk> ) , there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well . Sir Robert <unk> was Principal <unk> for Italy , Macedonia and Egypt , while Sir John James <unk> was Principal <unk> for Palestine and Gallipoli , assisted by Thomas Smith <unk> . The Principal <unk> for Mesopotamia was Edward <unk> Warren . 
 As well as these senior architects , there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs . These architects were younger , and many of them had served in the war . The Assistant Architects were : George <unk> Gordon <unk> , <unk> Clement von Berg , Charles Henry Holden ( who in 1920 became a Principal <unk> ) , William Harrison <unk> , William <unk> <unk> , George Hartley Goldsmith , Frank <unk> , Arthur James Scott Hutton , Noel Ackroyd <unk> , and John Reginald <unk> . Other architects that worked for the Commission , or won competitions for the Commission memorials , included George <unk> <unk> , Harold <unk> <unk> , <unk> Owen Rees , Gordon H. Holt , and Henry Philip <unk> de <unk> . 
 In January 1944 , Edward <unk> was appointed Principal <unk> for the UK . <unk> worked extensively for the Commission for 25 years until 1969 , becoming Chief <unk> and also succeeding Kenyon as Artistic <unk> . Together with <unk> , the other Principal Architects appointed during and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington , Louis de <unk> , Philip <unk> and Colin St Clair <unk> . 
 Leading <unk> that worked on the memorials and <unk> after the First World War included Eric Henri <unk> , Charles Thomas Wheeler , Gilbert <unk> , and Charles <unk> Jagger . Other <unk> , both in the inter @-@ war period and after the Second World War , included William Reid Dick , Ernest <unk> , Basil <unk> , Alfred Turner , Laurence A.

 = = = Cemetery design = = = 
 
 
 = = = = Common architectural design features = = = = 
 
 Structural design has always played an important part in the Commission 's <unk> . Apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , the <unk> follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . This makes the <unk> easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries . 
 A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance . For <unk> in France and Belgium , a land <unk> near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments . All but the smallest <unk> contain a register with an inventory of the burials , a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . The <unk> within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size . 
 The cemetery grounds are , except in drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the <unk> . There is also an absence of any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace . However , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature of the war deaths . 
 
 = = = = Cross of <unk> and Stone of Remembrance = = = = 
 
 Typically , <unk> of more than 40 graves contain a Cross of <unk> designed by architect Reginald <unk> . This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in <unk> in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross . The cross is normally a <unk> four @-@ point limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze <unk> , blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self @-@ sacrifice . 
 <unk> with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwin <unk> with the inscription " Their Name <unk> for <unk> " . The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by <unk> Kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively . In contrast to the Cross of <unk> , the design for the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <unk> . Each stone is 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar . The feature was designed using the principle of <unk> . The subtle curves in the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 @,@ <unk> feet 8 inches ( <unk> @.@ 15 m ) in diameter . 
 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 
 Every grave is marked with a <unk> . Each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . The <unk> use a standard upper case <unk> designed by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in straight rows and marked by uniform <unk> , the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone . The original <unk> dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) tall , 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide , and 7 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 Most <unk> are inscribed with a cross , except for those deceased known to be <unk> or non @-@ Christian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem . Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; in such cases their primary name is shown along with the <unk> " served as " . Many <unk> are for unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The <unk> , developed by <unk> Kipling , that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War known <unk> God " . Some <unk> bear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave . The <unk> does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death . 
 Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Thailand and Turkey , stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal <unk> . These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into <unk> ground . In Italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was in more plentiful supply . In <unk> Military Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small <unk> are laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia . 
 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 
 Commission <unk> are distinctive in treating <unk> as an integral part of the cemetery design . Originally , the <unk> concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting , in contrast to traditionally bleak <unk> . <unk> given by Arthur William Hill , the Assistant Director of the Royal <unk> Gardens at <unk> enabled the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life . <unk> structural and <unk> elements was not unfamiliar to the Commission 's architects . Sir Edwin <unk> furthered his long @-@ standing working relationship with <unk> Gertrude Jekyll , whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and <unk> greatly influenced the appearance of the <unk> . Where possible , indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home . 
 Variety in texture , height and timing of floral display were equally important <unk> <unk> . The beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Low @-@ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of <unk> , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from <unk> back during rain . In <unk> where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead . 
 The absence of any form of paving between the <unk> rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the garden <unk> , and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry <unk> is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission 's <unk> , as is the case in Iraq . <unk> areas require a different approach not only for <unk> , but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate <unk> <unk> in tropical climates . When many <unk> are concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of <unk> operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger <unk> have their own dedicated staff while small <unk> are usually tended by a single <unk> working part @-@ time .

 Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for the <unk> of remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors and <unk> for bodies by 12 @-@ man <unk> units . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , the <unk> units reburied 204 @,@ <unk> bodies . After 1921 , no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of the <unk> was transferred to the Commission . Despite the <unk> searches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 @,@ 000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly . 
 The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion ( Winnipeg <unk> ) , <unk> were discovered in a backyard in <unk> , France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re @-@ interred at <unk> Cemetery near <unk> , France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in <unk> @-@ le @-@ <unk> , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at <unk> British Cemetery . 
 When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission 's <unk> the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains , <unk> data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick <unk> , who was previously commemorated on the <unk> Flying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in <unk> , East @-@ Flanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonard <unk> was identified in 2013 after a visitor to <unk> British Cemetery discovered a <unk> of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date .

 <unk> , including those of war dead , are targets for vandalism . The gravestones , <unk> and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the <unk> <unk> by young people , noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays . <unk> thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the Cross of <unk> , which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass . 
 The vandalism of Commission <unk> has also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Troubles , Commission <unk> in Ireland experienced vandalism . <unk> defaced the central memorial of the <unk> Military Cemetery in northern France with anti @-@ British and anti @-@ American graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War . On 9 May 2004 , thirty @-@ three <unk> were demolished in the Gaza cemetery , which contains 3 @,@ 691 graves , allegedly in retaliation for the Abu <unk> prisoner abuse scandal .

The Ars is one of only two surviving 8th @-@ century Latin <unk> from England , and was based on the works of <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity , the five senses and the alphabet , and a book and a pen . The <unk> are formed in <unk> . The grammar is a reworking of <unk> 's Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other <unk> . It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language , but is designed for more advanced students . It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars , although not directly but through other <unk> works . There are also some examples drawn from the <unk> . The work was completed before he became archbishop , and was used not only in England but also on the continent . A recent edition of his works is <unk> Opera <unk> , published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin . 
 
 
 = German Type <unk> I submarine = 
 
 The Type <unk> I was a class of small coastal submarines ( U @-@ boats ) built in Germany at the beginning of the First World War . 20 boats were constructed , most of which went into service with the German Imperial Navy . Boats of this design were also operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( <unk> und <unk> Kriegsmarine or <unk> Kriegsmarine ) and the Bulgarian Navy . The group is sometimes known as the <unk> @-@ 1 class after SM <unk> @-@ 1 , the class leader . In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , it was called the U @-@ 10 class . 
 Built to meet the need for small <unk> submarines able to operate in the narrow , shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation . The design effort began in mid @-@ August 1914 and by mid @-@ October the first 15 boats were ordered from two German shipyards . The German Imperial Navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A total of 20 <unk> Is were built . Construction of the first boats for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats underwent trials in German home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or Pola . The German boats operated primarily in the Flanders , Baltic , and Constantinople <unk> . The boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . 
 In 1918 four of the surviving German boats were converted into coastal <unk> . Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One of the five Austro @-@ Hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four surviving Austro @-@ Hungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken up .

 In the earliest stages of the First World War the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun . 
 The German Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines must be <unk> by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 34 " — resulted in the Type <unk> I design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo tubes . 
 Boats of the Type <unk> I design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of Kiel and AG <unk> of <unk> , which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer at 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) length overall , while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came in 22 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) shorter than their counterparts . All were 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged , as they weighed 1 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ) more than the <unk> boats . 
 The <unk> of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> ( Germaniawerft ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) diesel engine on the surface , or a <unk> @-@ <unk> electric motor for underwater travel . The <unk> boats were capable of nearly 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) on the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . The Germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) slower than their <unk> @-@ made counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45 @-@ <unk> ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . They were also armed with a single 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun affixed to the deck .

 The German Imperial Navy ordered its first fifteen Type <unk> I boats on 15 October 1914 . Eight boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 1 to <unk> @-@ 8 — were ordered from Germaniawerft of Kiel , and seven boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 9 to U @-@ 15 — from AG <unk> of <unk> . After two of the class , <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 15 , were sold in February 1915 to ally Austria @-@ Hungary ( becoming U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ) , the German Imperial Navy ordered <unk> @-@ 16 and <unk> @-@ 17 from <unk> . A further three for Austria @-@ Hungary — U @-@ 15 , U @-@ 16 , and U @-@ 17 — had been ordered from <unk> by April , bringing the total number constructed to 20 . 
 <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germaniawerft yard at Kiel . <unk> @-@ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 working days later . <unk> @-@ 2 's launch followed on 13 February . Among the <unk> boats , <unk> @-@ 9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of <unk> @-@ 2 . These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point . 
 The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway <unk> . Type <unk> I boats destined for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to Antwerp for the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process . After assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed by barge to Bruges for trials . Boats selected for service in the Mediterranean were sent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of the <unk> from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks . 
 By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy Type <unk> Is had been completed . 
 
 = = Service = = 
 
 During their trials the Type <unk> Is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being <unk> ; one commander compared his Type <unk> I to a " <unk> machine " . According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice <unk> in their 1931 book The German <unk> War , 1914 – 1918 , the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down <unk> while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running . In @-@ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat was almost totally disabled . 
 Another reported problem with the Type <unk> Is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped with <unk> tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the C / 06 torpedo 's 1 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing from <unk> depth the boat could <unk> after firing or , if too much weight was taken on , <unk> to the depths . When <unk> @-@ 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarine <unk> in June 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance . 
 Despite the problems , the " tin <unk> " , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Boats of the class served in three navies : the German Imperial Navy , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , and the Bulgarian Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flotilla , and the Constantinople Flotilla .

By the end of April five more Type <unk> I boats had become operational . <unk> @-@ 10 was eventually joined in the Flanders Flotilla by <unk> @-@ 2 , <unk> @-@ 4 , <unk> @-@ 5 , <unk> @-@ 6 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 13 , <unk> @-@ 16 , and <unk> @-@ 17 ; of these , only <unk> @-@ 2 made the journey to Flanders by sea rather than rail . 
 <unk> @-@ 4 departed on the first patrol from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . The Type <unk> I boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English Channel after <unk> @-@ 6 pioneered a route past British <unk> nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June . 
 Over the Type <unk> Is ' first year of service , <unk> @-@ 4 and <unk> @-@ 13 were both lost , and <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 5 were transferred to the Baltic Flotilla . In March 1917 , <unk> @-@ 6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war , along with her crew . The four remaining Type <unk> Is in Flanders — <unk> @-@ 10 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 16 , <unk> @-@ 17 — were all converted to <unk> by 1918 , having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines . All but <unk> @-@ 10 were lost in 1918 ; <unk> @-@ 10 , in poor repair and out of service , was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders .

 The three Type <unk> I boats of the Constantinople Flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the Black Sea . <unk> @-@ 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , and <unk> @-@ 7 disappeared in the Black Sea in October 1916 , leaving <unk> @-@ 14 as the sole remaining German Type <unk> I in the flotilla ; she was surrendered at Sevastopol in November 1918 to French armies stationed there during the Russian Civil War .

 = Military history of Gibraltar during World War II = 
 
 The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar 's position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy , both as a foothold on the continent of Europe , and as a <unk> of British sea power . During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean . 
 In addition to its commanding position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Force H , under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral James <unk> was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta . During the course of the war , Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from <unk> French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force ( Regia <unk> ) based on Sardinia . Additionally , the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy ( Regia Marina ) commando <unk> unit ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and their human torpedoes . This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS <unk> in the nearby Spanish harbour of <unk> . A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish and <unk> agents acting on behalf of the German <unk> . 
 Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone . <unk> of rock were blasted out to build an " underground city " . In huge man @-@ made <unk> , barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were constructed , complete with an operating theatre and X @-@ ray equipment . 
 Operation <unk> , the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 , was coordinated from the " Rock " . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation . Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear @-@ area supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until V @-@ E Day in 1945 . 
 
 = = Prelude and evacuation = = 
 
 World War II dramatically changed the lives of <unk> . The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most <unk> ( some for up to ten years ) had nowhere to call ' home ' . Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort . 
 In early June 1940 , about 13 @,@ 500 <unk> were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco . However , following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940 , the new Pro @-@ German French <unk> Government found the presence of <unk> <unk> in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal . The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore <unk> , <unk> 15 @,@ 000 French servicemen who had been rescued from <unk> . Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked , the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the <unk> . Although <unk> was unable to obtain permission to clean and <unk> his ships ( and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of <unk> ) , when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards , he opened up his <unk> for boarding . Just beforehand , the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships at <unk> el @-@ <unk> in order to prevent them ending up in German hands . The attack , during which 1 @,@ <unk> French sailors died , led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry , leaving many possessions behind . However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , fearing that once the <unk> were back on the Rock , it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time . <unk> gathered in John <unk> Square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke , speeches were made and two City <unk> accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor ( Sir Clive <unk> ) to ask that the <unk> be allowed to land . After receiving instructions from London , a landing was allowed as long as the <unk> returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock , and by 13 July the re @-@ evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed . 
 British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the <unk> in the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of <unk> first as 13 @,@ 000 , then as 14 @,@ 000 and finally as 16 @,@ 000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 @,@ 000 could be accepted , 2 @,@ 000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General <unk> on 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 @,@ 000 . The 13 @,@ 000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . " In London the <unk> were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of <unk> letters , describing the circumstances in which the <unk> were living . 
 In September rumours were already circulating among the <unk> , and in Gibraltar , that the possibility of re @-@ evacuating the <unk> once more was being <unk> , this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island , and 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . However <unk> followed and the demands were met , partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The situation at the end of 1940 , therefore , was that approximately 2 @,@ 000 <unk> were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira , with the bulk of around 10 @,@ 000 housed in the London area . 
 
 = = Royal Air Force involvement : 1939 – 1941 = = 
 
 Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1 @,@ 550 yards ( 1 @,@ <unk> m ) . The land <unk> commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the " North Front " , now RAF Gibraltar . The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities , <unk> large in Admiralty thinking . So at 09 : 00 ( UTC ) on the 9 September 1939 , No. 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar , loaded to the <unk> with equipment . 
 On 25 September 1939 , No 200 ( Coastal ) Group was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 <unk> . The Group 's function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar . In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command . Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942 . 
 
 = = <unk> French attacks : 1940 = = 
 
 On 18 July 1940 , after the attack on the French Fleet at <unk> @-@ el @-@ <unk> by the British , the <unk> government authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little damage was reported to have been done . 
 On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a reprisal for the bombardment of <unk> yesterday morning , one @-@ hundred @-@ and @-@ twenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the United Press Agency reported : " The French government has issued an official denial of reports , according to which French aircraft were said to have attacked Gibraltar . Up until now , no <unk> have been undertaken . " But the United Press report ended on an ominous note with : " French <unk> are imminent . " 
 Again , on the same day , the <unk> French government issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of the <unk> French Air Force ( <unk> de l <unk> de <unk> ) and four squadrons of the <unk> French Navy ( Marine <unk> de <unk> ) were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers flew from bases in <unk> , <unk> ( in Algeria ) , <unk> , <unk> , and Port <unk> ( in Morocco ) . The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission . 
 No British aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress . The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out . 
 On 25 September , the French returned with a larger force of eighty @-@ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . Again , aircraft of the British Royal Air Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire . One <unk> 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks . The British armed trawler <unk> Stella Sirius was sunk by bombs . 
 The air attack on 25 September was the last by <unk> forces on Gibraltar . 
 
 = = Operation Felix : 1940 – 1941 = = 
 
 The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar . <unk> " Felix " , the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command . With or without permission , Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asia @-@ bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterward at Spanish air bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone . 
 <unk> failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940 . 
 General Ludwig <unk> 's <unk> Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment <unk> , the <unk> Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment of 150 <unk> , and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles ( <unk> ) , packed with high explosives . 
 As part of a combined @-@ force operation , the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) would contribute Ju <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , three light AA battalions , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U @-@ boats to interfere with British naval movement and <unk> coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy . 
 On 10 March 1941 , with Operation Barbarossa looming , Felix was amended to Operation Felix @-@ Heinrich , whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 's <unk> , the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned . 
 
 = = Italian bombing of Gibraltar = = 
 
 From Sardinia , Italian <unk> <unk> bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , mainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even the <unk> port . 
 The only unit of the Regia <unk> ( Royal Air Force ) ever to fly the <unk> <unk> was the " <unk> Long @-@ Range <unk> Squadron " . This unit was formed in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in June 1942 the <unk> became operational . The most spectacular raids with the P. 108 bombers were flown in October 1942 when several night attacks against Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia . 
 After the armistice of <unk> ( 8 September ) , the German @-@ allied Italian Social Republic launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with ten <unk> aircraft and another on 6 June with nine aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the <unk> <unk> " <unk> – <unk> " . 
 
 = = Italian <unk> raids 1940 – 1943 = = 
 
 Known as the " <unk> <unk> Horse of Gibraltar " , <unk> <unk> <unk> , an Italian commando <unk> unit created during the <unk> government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar . 
 Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italian <unk> originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa <unk> ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named <unk> <unk> . Their base was shifted later to the Italian <unk> SS <unk> , interned in <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> <unk> from Spain = = 
 
 Lesser known than the Italian actions were the sabotage operations and <unk> @-@ mine attacks carried out by Spanish and <unk> agents recruited in the <unk> de Gibraltar by the Germans . The <unk> contacted a Spanish staff officer from <unk> de Gibraltar , Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> <unk> , a Spanish officer , member of the <unk> and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the <unk> , to establish a network of <unk> with access to Gibraltar . <unk> <unk> designated Emilio <unk> <unk> , also a member of <unk> , as operations chief of the organisation . Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the <unk> . A combination of financial reward , ideological commitment and some threats and <unk> were used to gather a significant number of agents . According to the British intelligence , there were at least 183 Spaniards and <unk> involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar . 
 <unk> operations were ordered from Berlin in the late autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was <unk> , as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tunnel , and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield . In June 1941 , however , the British intelligence <unk> a new attempt , by a German agent , to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship . Another attempt failed when <unk> placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip . 
 <unk> , trained and equipped by the Germans , the <unk> sank the armed trawler <unk> Erin , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper <unk> <unk> , which resulted in the deaths of six British <unk> on 18 January 1942 . <unk> was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of <unk> <unk> , Manuel Romero Hume , who allowed him to beach a <unk> there . The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . In March 1942 , a <unk> , José Key , one of the most prominent agents working for the Germans , responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the <unk> was arrested and executed in <unk> Prison in late 1942 . By September 1942 , <unk> , whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , resigned and left Carlos <unk> , his second in command , in charge of the operations . In late 1942 , the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded . In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head of <unk> operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations . 
 In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by <unk> 's agents . The British , growing suspicious of some of the <unk> , banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced the <unk> to ask <unk> for new personnel . A <unk> working on the Rock , José Martín <unk> , was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at <unk> Island on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for <unk> , because he was cornered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside <unk> Staff Cave . After being sentenced to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British executioner Albert <unk> . A member of an unrelated <unk> sabotage network , Luis López <unk> @-@ <unk> ( also arrested in 1943 ) was executed by <unk> on the same day . <unk> himself was put under arrest by the Spanish police and <unk> . He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined the <unk> in Madrid , under direct orders of Wolfgang <unk> , <unk> <unk> , head of the sabotage section in Spain . After a <unk> attempt against the life of pro @-@ allied General José Enrique <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> network 's agent Juan José <unk> and a meeting between Anthony Eden and the Spanish ambassador at London , <unk> Fitz @-@ James Stuart , <unk> activities around Gibraltar came to an end . 
 
 = = Operation <unk> : 1941 – 1942 = = 
 
 Operation <unk> was a top @-@ secret British stay @-@ behind <unk> mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers . Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , three <unk> and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean . The team would then wire back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty . 
 They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released . 
 As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden ) was put together under Operation <unk> . 
 Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey <unk> and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord <unk> 's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing <unk> scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier @-@ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott ’ s ill @-@ <unk> expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray <unk> was called up as Surgeon @-@ Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation <unk> was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front . 
 The operation had been <unk> in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office in <unk> UK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " Operation Monkey " , yet facts were very sparse . 
 In 1997 " Stay Behind Cave " ( as it was nicknamed ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar <unk> Group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years . 
 In November 2006 Jim <unk> and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operation <unk> still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England . Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon @-@ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( <unk> ) . He recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task .

 The Mediterranean U @-@ boat Campaign lasted approximately from 21 September 1941 to May 1944 . The Kriegsmarine tried to isolate Gibraltar , Malta , and Suez and disrupt Britain 's trade routes . More than sixty U @-@ boats were sent to <unk> Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea . Many of these U @-@ boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain . Nine U @-@ boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged .

 Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid @-@ 1942 .

From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war . 
 In July 1942 , Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Operation <unk> . Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @-@ scale Anglo @-@ American operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operation <unk> itself , but also military command of Gibraltar . 
 General Eisenhower stayed at The <unk> , the official Governor 's residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote : 
 The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by <unk> electric bulbs . <unk> , cold air in block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the <unk> efforts of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of surface water that faithfully but <unk> <unk> off the seconds of the <unk> , almost <unk> , wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins . 
 One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports <unk> on Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types were <unk> into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway . Fighters had been shipped in <unk> and assembled on the airfield . Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF <unk> at North Front . 
 On 8 November 1942 , <unk> aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields . 
 From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation <unk> , the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces . 
 
 = = = War tunnels = = = 
 
 Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30 @,@ 000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .

On board was General Władysław <unk> , Prime Minister of Poland 's London @-@ based government in exile and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of its armed forces , returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East . 
 The aircraft climbed normally from the runway , levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour . The 62 @-@ year @-@ old general died , along with 15 others . The sole survivor was the Czech @-@ born pilot , Eduard <unk> , who was rescued by an RAF launch . The bodies of five passengers and crew , including <unk> 's daughter , were never found . 
 The coffins of General <unk> and his Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff , General <unk> , were draped in the Polish National Flag and lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the <unk> . After a <unk> Mass , the bodies were carried in procession to the <unk> Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General <unk> 's remains would one day be returned to a liberated Poland . The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish <unk> .

 In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of <unk> 's Liberator II <unk> , but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established " . A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls . Despite this finding , the political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that <unk> 's death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy .

 The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the <unk> to the Rock . As a result , a <unk> Board was established in November , and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed . On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1 @,@ 367 <unk> arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May , the first repatriation party left Madeira , and by the end of 1944 only 520 non @-@ priority <unk> remained on the island . 
 In London , home @-@ <unk> were making claims on the <unk> ’ wartime accommodation and 500 <unk> were re @-@ evacuated to Scotland and 3 @,@ 000 to camps in Northern Ireland . Although the Governor , Lt. General Sir Noel Mason @-@ MacFarlane , fought <unk> on behalf of the <unk> and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays . As late as 1947 there were still 2 @,@ 000 in Northern Irish camps . The last of the <unk> did not see the Rock again until 1951 .

 <unk> ( Latin : Marcus <unk> <unk> Caesar Augustus ; 8 November , 30 AD – 27 January , 98 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98 . <unk> became Emperor at the age of sixty @-@ five , after a lifetime of imperial service under <unk> and the rulers of the <unk> dynasty . Under <unk> , he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . Later , as a loyalist to the <unk> , he attained <unk> in 71 and 90 during the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> respectively . 
 On 18 September 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the <unk> Guard and several of his freedmen . On the same day , <unk> was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the <unk> government of <unk> . 
 <unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by the <unk> Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . After some <unk> <unk> adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office , <unk> died of natural causes on 27 January 98 . Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan . 
 Although much of his life remains obscure , <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians . <unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus founding the <unk> – <unk> dynasty .

 = = = Family = = = 
 
 Marcus <unk> <unk> was born in the village of <unk> , 50 kilometers north of Rome , to the family of Marcus <unk> <unk> , <unk> Consul in 40 , and <unk> <unk> . Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . He had at least one attested sister , named <unk> , who married Lucius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the brother of the future Emperor <unk> . 
 Like <unk> , the founder of the <unk> dynasty , <unk> was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining <unk> in each successive generation . The direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side , all named Marcus <unk> <unk> , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) . 
 His great @-@ grandfather was Consul in 36 BC ( in replacement , and abdicated ) , and Governor of Asia in the same year . His grandfather became Consul <unk> in July of either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor <unk> ( AD 14 – 37 ) , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 . <unk> 's father , finally , attained the <unk> in 40 under emperor <unk> ( 37 – 41 ) . The <unk> were connected with the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the marriage of <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the great @-@ granddaughter of <unk> . 
 
 = = = Imperial service = = = 
 
 Not much of <unk> 's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was <unk> @-@ elect in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . As an advisor to Emperor <unk> , he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . <unk> what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those of <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> . He received <unk> honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace . 
 According to the contemporary poet Martial , <unk> also held <unk> 's literary abilities in high esteem , <unk> him as the " <unk> of our time " . Another prominent member of <unk> 's entourage was <unk> , an old and respected general who had celebrated military <unk> during the 40s . It appears <unk> befriended <unk> during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over <unk> 's youngest son <unk> when <unk> departed for the Jewish war in 67 . 
 The suicide of <unk> on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty to an end , leading to the chaotic Year of the Four <unk> , which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , until the accession of <unk> on 21 December 69 . <unk> nothing is known of <unk> 's whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact that <unk> was his brother @-@ in @-@ law , he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the <unk> . 
 For services unknown , he was rewarded with a <unk> early in <unk> 's reign in 71 . This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary <unk> ( instead of a less prestigious <unk> <unk> ) , making him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured in this way under <unk> . After 71 <unk> again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under <unk> ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and <unk> ( 81 – 96 ) . 
 He re @-@ emerges during the revolt of <unk> in 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the governor of <unk> Superior , Lucius Antonius <unk> , and his two <unk> at <unk> , <unk> XIV <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the <unk> . The governor of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , moved to the region at once , assisted by the <unk> of <unk> , Titus <unk> <unk> . Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at <unk> <unk> punished . The <unk> <unk> were sent to the front of <unk> , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . 
 <unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the <unk> with <unk> . Again , the honour suggested <unk> had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under <unk> . Alternatively , <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ <unk> of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed , and the Empire could return to order .

 On 18 September , 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Calendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and <unk> , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot . <unk> by contrast does not mention <unk> , but he may have omitted his role out of <unk> . Considering the works of <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct descendants Trajan and <unk> , it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . On the other hand , <unk> lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known <unk> loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke . 
 Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health , <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> . Furthermore , he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate . <unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of <unk> ; he knew that to <unk> even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . Rather than decline the invitation and risk <unk> , he accepted . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against <unk> . 
 Following the accession of <unk> as emperor , the Senate passed <unk> <unk> on <unk> : his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many instances , existing portraits of <unk> , such as those found on the <unk> <unk> , were simply <unk> to fit the likeness of <unk> . This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material . In addition , the vast palace which <unk> had erected on the <unk> Hill , known as the <unk> Palace , was renamed the " House of the People " , and <unk> himself took up residence in <unk> 's former villa in the Gardens of <unk> . 
 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 
 The change of government was welcome particularly to the <unk> , who had been harshly persecuted during <unk> 's reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters , <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he remained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled . 
 All properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families . <unk> also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the Senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life . 
 Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , <unk> had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , a <unk> of 75 <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers of the <unk> Guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as 5000 <unk> per person . This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most <unk> Romans . 
 To the poorest , <unk> granted <unk> of land worth up to 60 million <unk> . He <unk> parents and their children from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 % to their municipality to support the children of <unk> families ; <unk> schemes which were later expanded by Trajan , <unk> Pius , and Marcus Aurelius . Furthermore , numerous taxes were <unk> and privileges granted to Roman provinces . <unk> , he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> , the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay : some of his coins bear the legend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax ) . 
 Before long , <unk> 's expenses strained the economy of Rome and , although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> , necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce <unk> . The most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions , including the <unk> of ships , estates , and even furniture . Large amounts of money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues , and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor . 
 Because he reigned only briefly , <unk> 's public works were few , instead completing projects which had been initiated under <unk> rule . This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the <unk> . The latter program was headed by the former consul <unk> Julius <unk> , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Rome 's water supply , De <unk> <unk> <unk> . The only major landmarks constructed under <unk> were a <unk> , known as the <unk> <unk> , and a small Imperial <unk> begun by <unk> , which linked the <unk> of Augustus to the Temple of Peace . Little remains , partly because the Via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it . 
 
 = = = Crisis of succession = = = 
 
 Despite <unk> 's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support for <unk> remained strong in the army , which had called for his <unk> immediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the <unk> Guard , <unk> had dismissed their prefect Titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander , <unk> <unk> . 
 Likewise , the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . The <unk> considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of <unk> 's assassins , which <unk> refused . Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign . 
 While the swift transfer of power following <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from <unk> , <unk> 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had ordered a halt to treason trials , but at the same time allowed the prosecution of <unk> by the Senate to continue . This measure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies , leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's <unk> was ultimately <unk> to <unk> 's anarchy . Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> failed , but once again <unk> refused to put the conspirators to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate . 
 The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor , made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives , who were unsuited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , <unk> was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the powerful governor of Syria . This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus <unk> <unk> , commonly known as Trajan , a general of the armies at the German frontier . 
 In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the <unk> Guard , led by <unk> <unk> , laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took <unk> hostage . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible for <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the rebellious <unk> . Titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> 's former <unk> , were sought out and killed . <unk> was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair . 
 He realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> in 98 : 
 Contrary to the view here popularized by <unk> <unk> , however , <unk> had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , <unk> ancestry , and connections was Trajan . Likewise , Edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good <unk> has found little support among modern historians . 
 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 
 On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth <unk> , <unk> suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of <unk> , on 28 January . He was deified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the <unk> of Augustus . 
 <unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of <unk> , yet no trace of it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death . According to <unk> <unk> , however , the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was ' dismissed ' upon Trajan 's accession . 
 Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign of <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century historian <unk> <unk> . His Roman History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival of <unk> in Italy until the year <unk> , was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died . Further details are added by an abridged biography from the <unk> de <unk> , a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian Aurelius Victor . 
 A more comprehensive text , presumed to describe the life of <unk> in closer detail , is the <unk> , by the contemporary historian <unk> . The <unk> is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor <unk> in 69 until the death of <unk> in 96 . Unfortunately , a substantial part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the Year of the Four <unk> remaining . In the introduction to his biography of <unk> Julius <unk> however , <unk> speaks highly of <unk> , describing his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ] <unk> Caesar blended things once <unk> , sovereignty and freedom " . 
 The surviving histories speak equally positively of <unk> 's brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies . Both <unk> <unk> and Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and <unk> , with <unk> commending his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir . These views were later popularized by the 18th @-@ century historian Edward <unk> in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . <unk> considered <unk> the first of the Five Good <unk> , five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was governed by absolute power , under the guidance of wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . Nevertheless , even <unk> notes that , compared to his successors , <unk> may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign : 
 Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but <unk> 's <unk> of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis . The mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> : 
 His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the <unk> of <unk> , ultimately became known as the <unk> <unk> , or transitional forum . 
 Two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found in towns associated with him . There is an <unk> statue in Gloucester , England , a town which was founded in his honour . It is at the entrance to <unk> Street . There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace , <unk> in Italy , at <unk> <unk> street .

 The <unk> novel had been optioned several times , including by Frank Sinatra , but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful . Director <unk> 's daughter Carol <unk> speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction . <unk> , who had <unk> pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool @-@ themed play called Corner Pocket , optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script . 
 According to Bobby <unk> 's agent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman 's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie . Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the <unk> . <unk> offered <unk> the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out of <unk> because of shooting <unk> on Cleopatra , Newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half of the script . No one associated with the production officially notified <unk> or his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race . 
 <unk> filmed The <unk> over six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now @-@ defunct pool halls , <unk> 's and Ames <unk> Academy . Other shooting locations included a <unk> on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton 's character <unk> , and the Manhattan <unk> bus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willie <unk> served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide @-@ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames . <unk> , in pursuit of the style he termed " neo @-@ neo @-@ realistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town ( originally slated to be the first scene of the film ) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny 's Bar which establishes Preacher is a <unk> . 
 Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing , but during filming <unk> made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie 's characters . Despite the change in emphasis , <unk> still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie 's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame . For example , when Eddie is playing <unk> , Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above <unk> while still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert . When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah 's body , Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat <unk> .

 The <unk> is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being , <unk> within the context of winning and losing . Describing the film , Robert <unk> said : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . He <unk> self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game .

" No film of the 1950s , <unk> asserts , " took such a brutal , clear look at the ego @-@ affirmation of the one @-@ on @-@ one contest , at the <unk> of the winner or the <unk> vulnerability of the loser . " Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir , <unk> rejects the comparison based on <unk> 's ultra @-@ realistic style , also noting that the film lacks noir 's " <unk> Woman or its <unk> in discovering crime among the <unk> , hungry bank clerks and <unk> wives . " <unk> does note that while Fast Eddie " has a slight fifties ring " , the character " makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the ' rebel ' era ...
